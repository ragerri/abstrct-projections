The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of augmenting trabeculectomy with subconjunctival mitomycin C ( TMMC ) versus 5-fluorouracil ( T5-FU ) in lowering intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . 
Forty eyes from 40 patients referred to the Nikoukari Ophthalmology University Hospital , Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran , were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial . 
Patients with high-risk open angle glaucoma were allocated to receive either subconjunctival TMMC or T5-FU . 
Mean overall preoperative IOP was 30.8 mmHg . 
Mean preoperative IOPs in the TMMC and T5-FU groups were 31.2 ± 9.8 and 30.6 ± 9.9 mmHg , respectively . Postoperatively , mean IOPs were 11.4 ± 4.9 and 13.6 ± 3.9 mmHg , respectively for TMMC and T5-FU groups after 6 months . 
In spite of some existing descriptive differences in IOP between the groups , statistical tests showed no difference in mean and median IOP . 
Three cases of hypotonia ( IOP < 6 mmHg ) and 1 case of epithelial keratitis were detected . 
TMMC and T5-FU appeared to have similar efficacy in lowering IOP . 
The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of the Ex-PRESS ( Optonol Ltd. , Neve Ilan , Israel ) mini glaucoma shunt in open-angle glaucoma . 
This was a prospective , randomized trial . 
Eyes from enrolled patients were randomly assigned to either Ex-PRESS implantation under a scleral flap , or trabeculectomy . 
The main outcome measures were : mean intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , postoperative medication use , visual acuity , and incidence of complications . /Users/anaryegen/Desktop/UPV/Master_Thesis/data/glaucoma/test_sents.txt
Complete success was defined as an IOP of > 4 mmHg and < or=18 mmHg without the use of antiglaucoma medications . 
A more stringent target of IOP > 4 mmHg and < or=15 mmHg was also noted . 
There were 78 patients ( 80 eyes ) with primary open-angle , pseudoexfoliative , or pigmentary glaucoma enrolled in the study . 
A total of 84.6 % of patients receiving Ex-PRESS and 60.0 % of patients receiving trabeculectomy ( P=0.0230 ) achieved complete success . 
The respective proportions of patients achieving an IOP > 4 mmHg and < or=15 mmHg were 76.9 % and 50.0 % ( P=0.0193 ) . 
At 1-year follow-up , complete success rates were 81.8 % for Ex-PRESS and 47.5 % for trabeculectomy ( P=0.0020 ) , and 71.7 % and 37.5 % ( P=0.0070 ) , respectively , for the more stringent target . 
There was a similar level of postoperative interventions and complications for each group . 
In open-angle glaucoma , the Ex-PRESS mini glaucoma shunt implanted under a superficial scleral flap produces significantly higher success rates , and a similar complication rate , compared with trabeculectomy . 
The Ex-PRESS is a safe and effective device for treating open-angle glaucoma . 
To compare the effects on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and side effects of monotherapy with either latanoprost or dorzolamide in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
224 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited to a 3 month open labelled study . 
Previous glaucoma medications were washed out and the patients were randomised to receive either latanoprost 0.005 % once daily or dorzolamide 2 % three times daily . 
Of 224 patients 213 were included in the analysis of efficacy . 
After 3 months , latanoprost reduced mean baseline diurnal IOP from 27.2 ( SD 3.0 ) mm Hg by 8.5 ( 3.3 ) mm Hg . 
The corresponding figures for dorzolamide were 27.2 ( 3.4 ) and 5.6 ( 2.6 ) mm Hg . 
The difference of 2.9 mm Hg ( 95 % CI : 2.3-3.6 ) was highly significant ( p < 0.001 , ANCOVA ) . 
Latanoprost reduced IOP at peak by 8.6 mm Hg ( 32 % ) compared with 6.2 mm Hg ( 23 % ) for dorzolamide , and the difference of 2.4 mm Hg was significant ( p < 0.001 , ANCOVA ) . 
The corresponding figures at trough were 8.1 mm Hg ( 31 % ) for latanoprost and 4.7 mm Hg ( 17 % ) for dorzolamide , a significant difference of 3.4 mm Hg ( p < 0.001 , ANCOVA ) . 
Both drugs were well tolerated systemically and locally . 
Latanoprost was superior to dorzolamide in reducing the IOP , judged both from the effect on IOP at peak and trough and by the effect on diurnal IOP . 
Approximately 40 % of patients with glaucoma are concomitantly prescribed > or=2 different intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering medications . 
An effective and well-tolerated fixed combination of agents requiring once-daily instillation may improve patient compliance . 
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of the fixed combination latanoprost 0.005 % + timolol maleate 0.5 % QD with those of latanoprost 0.005 % monotherapy QD in patients whose elevated IOP ( > or=21 mm Hg ) was inadequately controlled by latanoprost . 
This 21-day , randomized , double-masked , active-control study was conducted at 49 study sites in Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , Mexico , Peru , the United States , and Venezuela . 
Adults with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had failed to reach an IOP of < 21 mm Hg while receiving latanoprost for at least 28 days were enrolled . 
After an additional 28 days of latanoprost run-in , patients were randomly assigned to continue latanoprost monotherapy or to switch to the fixed combination for 21 days . 
The intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double-masked study medication ; the per-protocol ( PP ) analysis included patients who completed the study without a major protocol violation and who had IOP measurements both at baseline and at day 21 . 
The primary end point was the proportion of patients whose IOP was decreased > or=2 mm Hg from the baseline level on day 21 . 
Proportions of patients demonstrating IOP decreases > or=3 , > or=4 , or > or=5 mm Hg from the baseline level and of patients reaching an 10P < or=18 mm Hg were evaluated . 
Adverse events ( AEs ) were also assessed . 
A total of 350 patients were enrolled . 
In all , 348 patients were included in the ITT and tolerability analyses ( fixed combination , n = 175 ; latanoprost , n = 173 ; mean [ SD ] age , 64.4 [ 13.2 ] and 63.2 [ 14.0 ] years , respectively ; 103 women in each group ) . 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between groups . 
A higher percentage of patients receiving the fixed combination had IOP decreases of 2 mm Hg on day 21 relative to baseline compared with latanoprost-treated patients ( 79.4 % vs 51.4 % , respectively ; P < 0.001 ) . 
PP analyses found that more patients in the fixed-combination group had IOP decreases > or=3 , > or=4 , or > or=5 mm Hg ( for each target level , P < 0.001 vs latanoprost group ) or final IOP 18 mm Hg ( fixed -combination , 35.1 % ; latanoprost , 17.8 % ; P < 0.001 ) . 
Both treatments were well tolerated . 
Similar proportions of patients in the fixed-combination and latanoprost groups reported at least 1 treatment-emergent AE ( 10.9 % and 12.1 % , respectively ) . 
In this selected population of patients with an inadequate initial IOP response to latanoprost , switching to fixed-combination latanoprosttimolol resulted in a greater decrease in IOP and similar tolerability compared with continuing latanoprost therapy . 
To verify the safety and efficacy of Ologen ( OLO ) implant as adjuvant compared with low-dosage mitomycin-C ( MMC ) in trabeculectomy . 
This was a prospective randomized clinical trial with a 24-month follow-up . 
Forty glaucoma patients ( 40 eyes ) were assigned to trabeculectomy with MMC or OLO . 
Primary outcome includes target IOP at ≤21 , ≤17 , and ≤15 mmHg ; complete ( target IOP without medications ) , and qualified success ( target IOP regardless of medications ) . 
Secondary outcomes include bleb evaluation , according to Moorfields Bleb Grading System ( MBGS ) ; spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) examination ; number of glaucoma medications ; and frequency of postoperative adjunctive procedures and complications . 
The mean preoperative IOP was 26.5 ( ±5.2 ) in MMC and 27.3 ( ±6.0 ) in OLO eyes , without statistical significance . 
One-day postoperatively , the IOP dropped to 5.2 ( ±3.5 ) and 9.2 ( ±5.5 ) mm Hg , respectively ( P=0.009 ) . 
The IOP reduction was significant at end point in all groups ( P=0.01 ) , with a mean IOP of 16.0 ( ±2.9 ) and 16.5 ( ±2.1 ) mm Hg in MMC and OLO , respectively . 
The rates and Kaplan-Meier curves did not differ for both complete and qualified success at any target IOP . 
The bleb height in OLO group was higher than MMC one ( P < 0.05 ) . 
SD-OCT analysis of successful/unsuccessful bleb in patients with or without complete success at IOP =17 mm Hg indicated a sensitivity of 83 % and 73 % and a specificity of 75 % and 67 % , respectively , for MMC and OLO groups . 
No adverse reaction to OLO was noted . 
Our results suggest that OLO implant could be a new , safe , and effective alternative to MMC , with similar long-term success rate . 
To compare the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost with that of dorzolamide when added to timolol . 
This randomized , open-label study with two parallel groups was conducted in five centers in Greece . 
The study enrolled 148 patients with inadequately controlled open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma ( intraocular pressure of at least 22 mm Hg ) or ocular hypertension ( intraocular pressure of at least 27 mm Hg ) who were receiving monotherapy with a beta-blocker or dual therapy in which one of the agents was a beta-blocker . 
The patients were switched to timolol 0.5 % twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks ( run-in period ) before the start of the study ( baseline ) . 
At baseline , the patients were randomized to receive latanoprost 0.005 % once daily or dorzolamide 2 % twice daily as add-on therapy to timolol . 
The intraocular pressure was recorded at 9:30 AM , 12:30 PM , and 3:30 PM at baseline and at 3 months . 
Safety was followed throughout the study . 
The diurnal intraocular pressure reduction was significant in both groups ( P < 0.001 ) . 
The mean intraocular pressure reduction from baseline was 32 % for the latanoprost plus timolol group and 20 % for the dorzolamide plus timolol group . 
The least square estimate of the mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction after 3 months was -7.06 mm Hg in the latanoprost plus timolol group and -4.44 mm Hg in the dorzolamide plus timolol group ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Drugs administered in both treatment groups were well tolerated . 
This study clearly showed that the additive diurnal intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost is superior to that of dorzolamide in patients treated with timolol . 
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of latanoprost or brimonidine in patients with elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . 
This prospective , randomized , masked-evaluator , parallel-group , multicenter study in the United States included patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Patients received latanoprost 0.005 % once daily ( 8:00 AM ; n = 152 ) or brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % twice daily ( 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM ; n = 151 ) . 
Patients underwent evaluation at screening , baseline ( randomization ) , and after 0.5 , 3 , and 6 months of treatment . 
IOP was measured at 8:00 AM , 10:00 AM , noon , and 4:00 PM at baseline and the months 3 and 6 visits , and at 8:00 AM only at week 2 . 
The main outcome measure was the difference in diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 between treatment groups . 
Adverse events were recorded at each visit . 
Baseline mean diurnal IOP levels were similar between groups . 
At month 6 , the adjusted mean ( +/- SEM ) diurnal IOP reduction was 5.7 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the latanoprost group and 3.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in patients receiving brimonidine ( P < 0.001 ) . 
The mean difference in diurnal IOP reduction was 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg ( 95 % CI : 1.9 , 3.2 ; P < 0.001 ) . 
Five times more patients receiving brimonidine than latanoprost were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events . 
Latanoprost instilled once daily is more effective and better tolerated than brimonidine administered twice daily for the treatment of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
During therapy , the range of daily fluctuation of IOP is less for latanoprost compared with brimonidine . 
Brimonidin tartrate is a highly selective alpha 2-agonist . 
This study investigates the safety and efficacy of 0.2 % brimonidine administered twice daily for 1 year in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
The study design was a multicenter , double-masked , randomized , parallel-group , active-controlled comparison clinical trial . 
Subjects instilled 0.2 % brimonidine or 0.5 % timolol maleate twice daily for 12 months . 
Subjects were examined at baseline , week 1 , and months 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 . 
A subset of subjects was examined at week 2 . 
Of 443 subjects enrolled in this study , 374 met the entry criteria ; 186 received brimonidine and 188 received timolol . 
Brimonidine-treated subjects showed an overall mean peak reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of 6.5 mm Hg ; timolol-treated subjects had a mean peak reduction in IOP of 6.1 mm Hg . 
Brimonidine lowered mean peak IOP significantly more than timolol at week 2 and month 3 ( P < .03 ) ; no significant difference was observed between the groups for this variable at other visits throughout the 1-year course of the study . 
No evidence of tachyphylaxis was seen in either group . 
Allergy was seen in 9 % of subjects treated with brimonidine . 
Dry mouth was more common in the brimonidine-treated group than in the timolol-treated group ( 33.0 % vs 19.4 % ) , but complaints of burning and stinging were more common in the timolol-treated group ( 41.9 % ) than in the brimonidine-treated patients ( 28.1 % ) . 
Headache , fatigue , and drowsiness were similar in the 2 groups . 
In general , the tolerance to medication was acceptable . 
Brimonidine is safe and effective in lowering IOP in glaucomatous eyes . 
Brimonidine provides a sustained long-term ocular hypotensive effect , is well tolerated , and has a low rate of allergic response . 
To compare phacoemulsification versus trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C in medically uncontrolled chronic angle-closure glaucoma ( CACG ) without cataract . 
Prospective , randomized clinical trial . 
Fifty medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract of 50 patients . 
Patients were randomized into undergoing either phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C. After surgery , patients were followed up every 3 months for 2 years . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and requirement for glaucoma drugs . 
Twenty-six CACG eyes were randomized to receive phacoemulsification , and 24 eyes underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery ( reduction of 8.4 mmHg or 34 % for phacoemulsification vs 8.9 mmHg or 36 % for trabeculectomy ; P=0.76 ) . 
Over first 24 months , trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes ( P < 0.001 ) . 
However , trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification ( 46 % vs 4 % ; P=0.001 ) . 
Eight ( 33 % ) of 24 trabeculectomy eyes demonstrated cataract during follow-up . 
Both phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy are effective in reducing IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract . 
Trabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing dependence on glaucoma drugs , but is associated with more complications . 
To compare phacoemulsification alone and phacoemulsification with micro-bypass stent implantation in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma . 
Instituto di Fisiopatologia Clinica , Clinica Oculistica , Universita ' di Torino , Torino , Italy . 
In this prospective double-masked randomized clinical trial , patients had phacoemulsification alone ( control group ) or phacoemulsification with iStent implantation ( combined group ) . 
Primary outcomes were intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and reduction in medication use over 15 months and IOP after a 1-month washout of ocular hypotensive agents ( ie , 16 months postoperatively ) . 
The baseline IOP was similar between groups ( combined group : 17.9 mm Hg +/- 2.6 [ SD ] ; control group : 17.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg ) ( P = .512 ) . 
Three patients in the control group were lost to follow-up . 
The mean IOP was 14.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg in the combined group and 15.7 +/- 1.1 mm Hg in the control group at 15 months and 16.6 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 19.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg , respectively , after washout ; the IOP was statistically significantly lower in the combined group than in the control group at both time points ( P = .031 and P = .042 , respectively ) . 
At 15 months , the mean number of medications was lower in the combined group than in the control group ( 0.4 +/- 0.7 and 1.3 +/- 1.0 , respectively ; P = .007 ) , as was the proportion of patients on ocular hypotensive medication ( 33 % and 76 % , respectively ) . 
Phacoemulsification with stent implantation was more effective in controlling IOP than phacoemulsification alone ; the safety profiles were similar . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lowering efficacy and side effects of latanoprost 0.005 % and bimatoprost 0.03 % in subjects with chronic primary angle closure glaucoma ( PACG ) . 
This was an observer-masked randomised crossover study of 60 PACG subjects who received either latanoprost or bimatoprost for 6 weeks , after which they were crossed over to the other medication for another 6 weeks . 
The IOP-reducing effect of the medications was assessed by the reduction in IOP after 6 weeks of treatment compared with baseline . 
Fifty-four subjects ( 80 eyes ) completed the study . 
Latanoprost reduced IOP ( mean ( SD ) ) by 8.4 ( 3.8 ) mm Hg and bimatoprost by 8.9 ( 3.9 ) mm Hg from a baseline of 25.2 ( 3.6 ) mm Hg and 25.2 ( 3.6 ) mm Hg respectively ( p = 0.23 ) . 
Adverse events were mild in both groups ; however there were twice as many reports of an adverse event in the bimatoprost group ( 81 % ) compared with the latanoprost group ( 40 % , p < 0.01 ) . 
Ocular irritation was the most frequently reported adverse event in both groups ; 22 subjects ( 37.9 % ) treated with bimatoprost experienced ocular hyperaemia as compared with 13 subjects ( 22.4 % ) treated with latanoprost ( p = 0.11 ) . 
Bimatoprost once daily was similarly effective in reducing IOP compared with latanoprost once daily in subjects with chronic PACG . 
Both drugs were well tolerated with mild ocular adverse events . 
Latanoprost , a new prostaglandin analogue , was compared with timolol for ocular hypotensive efficacy and side effects . 
In a multicenter , randomized , double-masked , parallel group study , 268 patients with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle glaucoma received either 0.005 % latanoprost once daily or 0.5 % timolol twice daily for 6 months . 
All except ten patients from each group successfully completed the study . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was significantly ( P < 0.001 ) reduced and maintained by both medications without evidence of a long-term drift over 6 months . 
Comparing 6-month with baseline diurnal IOP values , the IOP reduction ( mean +/- standard deviation ) achieved with latanoprost ( -6.7 +/- 3.4 mmHg ) was significantly ( P < 0.001 ) greater than that produced with timolol ( 4.9 +/- 2.9 mmHg ) . 
Four patients treated with timolol and none treated with latanoprost were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate IOP control . 
Pulse rate was significantly reduced with timolol , but not with latanoprost . 
Slightly more conjunctival hyperemia appeared in latanoprost-treated compared with timolol-treated eyes . 
Fewer subjective side effects occurred in latanoprost-treated eyes . 
Both eyes of a patient with a characteristic , concentric iris heterochromia ( darker centrally ) at baseline showed a definite , photographically documented increase in pigmentation during latanoprost treatment , making the irides uniformly darker . 
Three additional patients treated with latanoprost were suspects for this color change . 
Otherwise , no significant difference between treatment groups occurred visual acuity , slit-lamp examination , blood pressure , and laboratory values . 
Latanoprost has the potential for becoming a new first-line treatment for glaucoma . 
Efficacy of the latanoprost versus timolol/dorzolamide combination therapy in patients with primary open angle glaucoma 
The study was designed as a 6 months randomized , observer-masked study comprising 120 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma in Feiz Hospital , Isfahan , Iran , from 2006 to 2007 . 
The patients were randomized ( latanoprost , n = 60 ; dorzolamide/timolol , n = 60 ) to treatment with either latanoprost , 0.005 % once daily , or the combination of timolol 0.5 % twice daily , and dorzolamide 2 % 3 times daily . 
The mean intraocular pressure ( IOP ) after one , 3 , and 6 months of treatment was compared with baseline in the 2 groups . 
A total of 120 patients were randomized to 2 equal treatment groups . 
The mean baseline IOP values were similar between the 2 groups . 
The mean ( standard error of mean [ SE ] ) IOP reductions at months one was 7.2 ( 0.4 ) , at month 3 was 7.3 ( 0.4 ) , and at month 6 was 7.1 ( 0.3 ) mm Hg for the latanoprost group and 7.5 ( 0.3 ) , 7.8 ( 0.3 ) , and 7.4 ( 0.3 ) mm Hg for the dorzolamide/timolol group . 
The 2 therapies were similarly effective . 
The latanoprost and dorzolamide/timolol combination were equally effective at lowering IOP compared to untreated baseline . 
To compare the effectiveness and safety of excimer laser trabeculotomy ( ELT ) ab interno vs selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) over 24 months of follow-up in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) refractory to medical therapy . 
This prospective , randomized study included 30 consecutive eyes assigned randomly to either ELT or SLT group . 
ELT was carried out using a XeCl Excimer Laser with an emission wavelength of 308 nm . 
Eight spots were equally distributed at a distance of 500 microm from one another over the anterior trabeculum . 
The SLT patients were treated with a frequency-doubled q-switched neodymium : yytrium-aluminum-garnet laser ( wavelength 532 nm ) . 
Approximately 50 adjacent , but not overlapping , laser spots were distributed over 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork , using an energy level ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mJ per pulse . 
The main outcome measure was intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lowering after ELT and SLT . 
Success was defined as > or=20 % reduction in IOP without further glaucoma intervention . 
At 24 months , complete success rates were 53.3 % for the ELT group and 40 % for the SLT group ( P=0.35 , Fisher 's exact test ) ; qualified success rates were 33.3 % for the ELT and 26.6 % for the SLT group ( P=0.5 , Fisher 's exact test ) . 
Mean IOP decreased from 25.0+/-1.9 to 17.6+/-2.2 mmHg ( -29.6 % ; P < 0.0001 ) in the ELT group and from 23.9+/-0.9 to 19.1+/-1.8 mmHg ( -21 % ; P < 0.0001 ) in the SLT group . 
Both ELT and SLT proved to be effective techniques in the treatment of POAG refractory to medical therapy . 
To compare the ocular hypotensive activity and safety profile of long-acting 1 % carteolol hydrochloride eye drops ( long-acting formulation ) to those of 1 % carteolol hydrochloride eye drops ( currently prescribed drug ) for reduction of intraocular pressure . 
Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension ( 146 cases ) were assigned randomly to the long-acting drug group ( 74 cases ) and the currently-prescribed drug group ( 72 cases ) . 
Long-acting eye drops were instilled once a day in the morning ( along with one drop of placebo at night ) , and currently-prescribed eye drops were instilled twice a day in the morning and at night . 
Eye drops were administered for 8 weeks . 
Intraocular pressure was monitored at 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after the initiation of drug instillation for evaluation of equivalence . 
Intraocular pressure was significantly reduced during the entire follow-up period in both groups . 
In the long-acting drug group , the reduction of intraocular pressure was -3.5 +/- 0.2 , -4.3 +/- 0.2 and -4.6 +/- 0.3 mmHg at 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks , respectively ( paired t test ) . 
In the currently-prescribed drug group , the reduction of intraocular pressure was -4.1 +/- 0.2 , -4.4 +/- 0.3 and -- 4.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg at 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks ( paired t test ) . 
The safety profile was similar in both groups , and the tolerance for the long-acting eye drops was as good as for the currently-prescribed eye drops . 
Because the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent , with an identical safety profile , the long-acting eye drops seem to be an efficacious formulation for clinical use in Japanese glaucoma patients . 
The newer ocular hypotensive agents available to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension ( OHT ) include latanoprost , a prostaglandin F ( 2alpha ) analogue , and the fixed combination of dorzolamide hydrochloride , a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , and timolol maleate , a beta-blocker . 
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of latanoprost with that of the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol over 8 weeks . 
This interventional , 8-week , randomized , open-label , parallel-group study was conducted at 18 centers in 6 Latin American countries . 
Patients with unilateral or bilateral primary open-angle , pigmentary , or exfoliative glaucoma or OHT were randomized to receive latanoprost , 1 drop in the affected eye QD ( evening ) , or fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol , 1 drop in the affected eye BID ( morning and evening ) . 
Medications were self-administered , 1 drop per affected eye . 
At baseline and week 8 , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was measured 3 times each at 8:30 am , 10:00 am , 2:00 pm , and 5:00 pm and after the water-drinking test , which estimates the IOP peak of diurnal tension curve , performed following the 5:00 pm IOP assessment . 
The primary efficacy outcome was change in diurnal IOP ( the mean of IOP measurements ) from baseline to week 8 . 
Adverse effect ( AE ) data were recorded at each visit . 
A total of 229 patients were randomized ( latanoprost , n = 112 ; dorzolamide/timolol , n = 117 ) . 
Mean baseline diurnal IOP values were similar between the 2 groups . 
Mean ( SD ) diurnal IOP reductions at week 8 before the water-drinking test were 6.9 ( 3.0 ) mm Hg for the latanoprost group and 6.4 ( 3.2 ) mm Hg for the dorzolamide/timolol group . 
Mean IOP values were similar at all time points except at 5:00 pm , when levels were significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients ( P = 0.025 ) . 
After the water-drinking test , the increase in IOP values was similar between groups at baseline but lower in latanoprost-treated patients at week 8 ( adjusted difference , 1.08 mm Hg ; P = 0.012 ) . 
Fewer patients treated with latanoprost reported ocular or systemic AEs ( P = 0.025 and P < 0.001 , respectively ) . 
In this study of patients with unilateral or bilateral primary open-angle , pigmentary , or exfoliative glaucoma or OHT IOP reductions generally were similar between treatment groups , except at 5:00 pm , when the mean IOP level was significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients . 
Latanoprost was better tolerated than fixed-combination dorzolamide and timolol . 
To compare the clinical success rates and quality of life impact of brimonidine 0.2 % with timolol 0.5 % in newly diagnosed patients naive to glaucoma therapy . 
A prospective , multicenter , randomized , double-masked , clinical effectiveness trial in which the clinical outcomes of twice daily brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % were compared with those of timolol maleate 0.5 % in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension was conducted . 
Two hundred nineteen patients were enrolled -- 111 in the brimonidine group and 108 in the timolol group . 
Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 months . 
Factors for determining clinical success were reduction of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , safety , and adverse events . 
Quality of life effects were assessed with the SF-36 Health Survey and Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaires . 
Clinical success was 71 % ( 75/106 ) with brimonidine and 70 % ( 73/105 ) with timolol as initial treatment . 
The overall mean decrease in IOP was 6.5 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.2 mm Hg with timolol . 
Few patients reported a specific adverse event and , with the exception of a slightly higher rate of ocular burning and stinging in the brimonidine group , there were no significant between-group differences . 
No significant chronotropic effects on the heart were seen with brimonidine , while small but significant mean decreases in heart rate were seen at months 1 and 4 with timolol . 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups . 
Quality of life remained stable , with no significant between-group differences . 
As a first-line agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension , brimonidine has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol , but with less chronotropic effect on the heart . 
Brimonidine is a viable alternative to timolol for first-line therapy in glaucoma and ocular hypertension . 
To compare the alpha2-adrenergic agonist brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % to the beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol maleate 0.5 % in preserving visual function in low-pressure glaucoma . 
Randomized , double-masked , multicenter clinical trial . 
Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) > 21 mm Hg , visual field mean deviation worse than -16 decibels , or contraindications to study medications . 
Both eyes received twice-daily monotherapy randomized in blocks of 7 ( 4 brimonidine to 3 timolol ) . 
Standard automated perimetry and tonometry were performed at 4-month intervals . 
Main outcome measure was field progression in either eye , defined as the same 3 or more points with a negative slope -1 dB/year at P < 5 % , on 3 consecutive tests , assessed by pointwise linear regression . 
Secondary outcome measures were progression based on glaucoma change probability maps ( GCPM ) of pattern deviation and the 3-omitting method for pointwise linear regression . 
Ninety-nine patients were randomized to brimonidine and 79 to timolol . 
Mean ( +/- SE ) months of follow-up for all patients was 30.0 +/- 2 . 
Statistically fewer brimonidine-treated patients ( 9 , 9.1 % ) had visual field progression by pointwise linear regression than timolol-treated patients ( 31 , 39.2 % , log-rank 12.4 , P=.001 ) . 
Mean treated IOP was similar for brimonidine- and timolol-treated patients at all time points . 
More brimonidine-treated ( 28 , 28.3 % ) than timolol-treated ( 9 , 11.4 % ) patients discontinued study participation because of drug-related adverse events ( P=.008 ) . 
Similar differences in progression were observed when analyzed by GCPM and the 3-omitting method . 
Low-pressure glaucoma patients treated with brimonidine 0.2 % who do not develop ocular allergy are less likely to have field progression than patients treated with timolol 0.5 % . 
To compare two intraocular irrigating solutions , Balanced Salt Solution Plus ( BSS Plus ) versus Lactated Ringer 's ( Ringer ) , for the preservation of corneal integrity after phacoemulsification . 
110 patients undergoing phacoemulsification were randomised to either BSS Plus ( n=55 ) or Ringer ( n=55 ) as the irrigating solution . 
Patients were examined at baseline and at 1 , 8 , 15 , 30 and 60 days postoperatively . 
Evaluations included specular microscopy to evaluate endothelial cell density ( ECD ) and endothelial cell size variability ( CV ) , and corneal pachymetry for central corneal thickness ( CCT ) measurement . 
Groups were well balanced regarding baseline ECD , CV and CCT ( p > 0.05 ) . 
There was no statistically significant difference between ECD reduction in group BSS Plus 13.1 ± 2.0 % and Ringer 9.2 ± 1.9 % ( p < 0.05 ) at day 60 or in any study visit . 
There was no statistically significant difference between CV increase in group BSS Plus 23.0 ± 3.0 % and Ringer 20.2 ± 4.0 % ( p < 0.05 ) at day 60 or in any study visit . 
CCT was significantly increased ( p < 0.05 ) at 1 , 8 , 15 and 30 days postoperatively , returning to baseline at 60 days in both groups . 
There was no significant difference in CCT increase in both groups at any visit . 
Interestingly , there were statistically significant correlations between ECD loss and phacoemulsification time ( p < 0.0001 ) and ECD loss and irrigation solution volume ( p < 0.0001 ) in the Ringer group , but not in the BSS Plus group . 
Ringers solution was similar to BSS Plus for corneal preservation in atraumatic cataract surgery . 
However , our study demonstrates that there is a trend towards lower postoperative endothelial cell density for surgeries with longer phacoemulsification time and higher irrigation volumes if Ringer is used . 
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of the fixed combination of timolol maleate 0.5 % /brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % versus fixed combination of timolol maleate 0.5 % /dorzolamide 2 % in patients with elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) over 8 weeks . 
This 8-week , multicentric , interventional , randomized , open-label , parallel group study was conducted at 4 centers in Brazil and 1 center in Argentina . 
Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive bilaterally fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol maleate 0.5 % or fixed combination of dorzolamide 2 % /timolol 0.5 % twice daily at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM . 
A modified diurnal tension curve ( 8:00 AM , 10:30 AM , 02:00 PM , and 4:00 PM ) followed by the water drinking test ( WDT ) , which estimates IOP peak of diurnal tension curve , were performed in the baseline and week-8 visits . 
Adverse events data were recorded at each visit . 
A total of 210 patients were randomized ( brimonidine/timolol , n=111 ; dorzolamide/timolol , n=99 ) . 
Mean baseline IOP was 23.43+/-3.22 mm Hg and 23.43+/-4.06 mm Hg in the patients treated with brimonidine/timolol and dorzolamide/timolol , respectively ( P=0.993 ) . 
Mean diurnal IOP reduction after 8 weeks were 7.02+/-3.06 mm Hg and 6.91+/-3.67 mm Hg , respectively ( P=0.811 ) . 
The adjusted difference between groups ( analysis of covariance ) at week 8 was not statistically significant ( P=0.847 ) . 
Mean baseline WDT peak was 27.79+/-4.29 mm Hg in the brimonidine/timolol group and 27.68+/-5.46 mm Hg in the dorzolamide/timolol group . 
After 8 weeks of treatment , mean WDT peaks were 20.94+/-3.76 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) and 20.98+/-4.19 ( P < 0.001 ) , respectively . 
The adjusted difference between groups ( analysis of covariance ) was not statistically significant ( P=0.469 ) . 
No statistical difference in terms of adverse events was found between groups . 
Both fixed combinations were capable of significantly reducing the mean diurnal IOP , mean diurnal peak , and mean WDT peak after 8 weeks of treatment . 
Also , both fixed combinations are well tolerated with few side effects . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ) -lowering effect and side effects of latanoprost 0.005 % once daily with unoprostone 0.12 % twice daily . 
Sixty patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening and placebo once daily in the morning , or unoprostone twice daily in the morning and evening . 
The study was double masked and followed a crossover design with two treatment periods of 1 month separated by a 3-week washout period . 
The intraocular pressure was measured at 9 AM and 5 PM on the baseline and day 28 visits , and at 9 AM on day 2 and day 14 visits of each treatment period . 
The 9 AM measurement was taken 2 hours and 13 hours after the last drop of unoprostone and latanoprost , and the 5 PM measurement was at 10 and 21 hours , respectively . 
The mean of the measurements was calculated . 
Safety parameters were also recorded . 
Fifty-six patients completed both treatment periods and had intraocular pressure data available for evaluation . 
After 1 month of treatment , latanoprost significantly reduced intraocular pressure ( mean +/- SEM ) by 6.1 +/- 0.5 mm Hg ( P < .001 ) and unoprostone by 4.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg ( P < .001 ) adjusted from an overall baseline of 22.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg and 23.2 +/- 0.4 mm Hg , respectively . 
The difference of 1.9 mm Hg between treatments was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost [ P =.003 , analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) ] . 
Unadjusted analysis of responders using the percentage decrease in intraocular pressure showed that the proportion of responders in the latanoprost-treated group was greater than in the unoprostone-treated group . 
Adverse ocular symptoms and findings were mild in both treatment groups . 
Eye redness and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events . 
Latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective in reducing intraocular pressure compared with unoprostone twice daily after 1 month of treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension . 
Both drugs were well tolerated with few ocular adverse events . 
To compare latanoprost and timolol with regard to changes in the intervisit intraocular pressure ( IOP ) range , a measure of long-term IOP fluctuation . 
Post hoc analysis of three 6-month , multicenter , randomized ( 1:1 ) , double-masked registration trials of latanoprost ( n = 313 ) vs timolol ( n = 318 ) . 
Analyses included patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who instilled latanoprost once daily in the evening and vehicle in the morning and those instilling timolol twice daily . 
Pretreatment intervisit IOP range : highest IOP minus lowest IOP of 4 measurements obtained at screening and baseline . 
Posttreatment intervisit IOP range : highest IOP minus lowest IOP of 4 measurements obtained at weeks 18 and 26 . 
Ranges were dichotomized to high ( > 6 mm Hg ) and low ( < or = 6 mm Hg ) . 
Both treatments resulted in significant reductions in mean intervisit IOP range during 26 weeks . 
Pretreatment , comparable proportions of patients treated with latanoprost and timolol had high intervisit IOP ranges ( 22 % [ 70/313 ] and 23 % [ 72/318 ] , respectively ; P = .934 ) . 
After treatment , 6 % ( 19/313 ) and 11 % ( 35/318 ) of patients in the latanoprost and timolol groups , respectively , had high intervisit IOP ranges ( P = .026 ) . 
Significant risk factors for high posttreatment intervisit range ( multivariate logistic regression ) were high pretreatment intervisit IOP range , treatment with timolol , Black race , longer time since diagnosis , and higher mean pretreatment IOP . 
Compared with timolol , treatment with latanoprost results in significantly fewer patients with a high IOP fluctuation . 
The impact of reducing high IOP fluctuation on progressive glaucomatous damage deserves further investigation in prospective studies . 
To report a randomized clinical trial of postoperative subconjunctival injections of low-dose 5-fluorouracil in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy . 
In a prospective , randomized clinical trial , 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to the low-dose 5-fluorouracil group and received three subconjunctival injections of 5 mg each over 11 postoperative days , and 40 eyes of 40 patients were randomized to trabeculectomy without 5-fluorouracil . 
Mean ( +/-SD ) preoperative and 1-year postoperative intraocular pressures in the 5-fluorouracil group were 26.9 ( +/-9.5 ) and 15.3 ( +/-5.8 ) mm Hg , respectively . 
In the control group these were 25.9 ( +/-8.1 ) mm Hg , and 15.8 ( +/-5.1 ) mm Hg , respectively . 
The patients who received 5-fluorouracil had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 11.5 ( +/-9.1 ) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.3 weeks . 
The control group had a mean reduction in intraocular pressure of 10.2 ( +/-8.7 ) mm Hg at a median follow-up of 52.6 weeks . 
These differences were not statistically significant . 
Three postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil injections of 5 mg each after trabeculectomy in eyes at low risk for failure had no statistically or clinically significant effect on reduction of intraocular pressure with 1-year follow-up . 
Enhancement of success in this group of patients may require a larger total dose of 5-fluorouracil . 
To compare the longitudinal effects of treatment on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and visual field performance in Japanese normal-tension glaucoma ( NTG ) between latanoprost and timolol . 
This is an open-label , randomized , study . 
A total of 62 NTG patients were prospectively , consecutively enrolled . 
All study subjects were randomly assigned to 0.005 % latanoprost instillation once daily in the morning or 0.5 % timolol instillation twice daily for a prospective 3-year follow-up , and underwent a routine ocular examination every month . 
Automated perimetry was performed every 6 months using Humphrey field analysers . 
Stereophotographs of optic discs were also obtained every 6 months . 
Percentage of IOP reduction or the magnitude of IOP reduction showed no intergroup differences either at any time point ( 13-15 % ) . 
In the visual field , the estimated rate of change in the MD value ( dB/year ) was -0.34+/-0.17 ( SE ) for the latanoprost group , and -0.10+/-0.18 ( SE ) for the timolol group . 
The estimated rate of change in MD showed no significant difference from zero in both groups , and there were no statistical intergroup differences . 
No changes in the optic nerve head topography in the vertical cup-to-disc ratio and rim area measured by image-analysis techniques were observed in either group . 
There were no patients who dropped out due to the side effects of treatment regimens . 
Both latanoprost and timolol single treatments reduced IOP by 13-15 % at their trough effects for 3 years in Japanese NTG patients ; both showed similar effects on visual field performance . 
Latanoprost is a PGF2 alpha analogue which reduces the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) by increasing the uveoscleral outflow . 
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of two different regimens of latanoprost on the diurnal IOP and also the effect of latanoprost on the blood-aqueous barrier measured with a laser flare cell meter ( Kowa FM-500 ) . 
Moreover , the safety aspects of the two regimens regarding hyperemia were studied . 
A double-masked , randomized study was performed in 30 patients ( 9 males , 21 females ; mean age 61.9 years ) with primary open-angle glaucoma or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma . 
Twenty patients were treated with latanoprost 0.0015 % twice daily or 0.005 % once daily for 3 weeks in a cross-over design . 
Ten patients received timolol 0.5 % twice daily as control . 
Latanoprost 0.005 % once daily reduced IOP ( +/- SEM ) more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015 % twice daily ( 9.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and 6.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg , respectively ) . 
There was a statistically significant increase in the aqueous humour protein concentration within the timolol group ( P = 0.004 ) , but not within the latanoprost group ( P = 0.97 ) . 
There was no statistically significant difference in the change in aqueous humour protein concentration from baseline between latanoprost and timolol groups ( P = 0.08 ) . 
No statistically significant difference in conjunctival hyperemia between the two latanoprost regimens was found ( P = 0.37 ) . 
Latanoprost 0.005 % once daily reduced IOP more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015 % twice daily ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Latanoprost had no statistically or clinically significant effect on the blood-aqueous barrier . 
There was no difference in hyperemia between the two regimens . 
Both concentrations of latanoprost reduced IOP at least as well as timolol 0.5 % eye drops . 
We conducted a prospective , randomized study to compare mitomycin with fluorouracil for efficacy and safety as an adjunct to trabeculectomy in eyes with glaucoma with poor surgical prognosis . 
Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients were randomly allocated to either mitomycin ( 17 eyes ) or fluorouracil therapy ( 15 eyes ) . 
Mitomycin ( 0.2 mg ) was applied only once during trabeculectomy , and fluorouracil ( 5 mg ) was subconjunctivally injected 10 times in the 2 weeks after surgery . 
Fifteen eyes ( 88 % ) in the mitomycin group and seven ( 47 % ) in the fluorouracil group achieved an intraocular pressure of less than or equal to 20 mm Hg without antiglaucoma medication . 
The follow-up period was 7 to 12 months . 
Corneal complications were less common in the group given mitomycin than in that given fluorouracil ( 12 % vs 53 % ) . 
The incidence of other complications was similar between the two groups . 
trabeculectomy is the standard surgical procedure for management of glaucoma . 
to compare the outcome of triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy . 
this study was carried out in the Department ofOphthalmology , BPKIHS , Dharan , over a period of one year . 
A total of 22 patients undergoing trabeculectomy were randomized to undergo either trabeculectomy with triangular scleral flap ( Group A= 11 eyes ) or trabeculectomy with rectangular flap ( Group B = 11 eyes ) . 
the parameters studied were intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) , bleb characteristics and surgical complications . 
P value of < 0.05 was considered significant . 
All calculations were executed using SPSS 11.0 software program . 
the age ranged between 40 to 76 years with the mean of 56.5 +/- 9.25 years . 
The most common preoperative diagnosis was angle closure glaucoma . 
The postoperative percentage of IOP reduction ( Group A 68.9 % ; Group B 66.51 % ) was statically significant in both the groups ( p=0.001 ) . 
Trabeculectomy was almost equally effective with complete surgical success of 91 % in group A , and 82 % in group B ( p=0.534 ) . 
Final bleb scores were almost similar in both the groups with 3.27 +/- 1.5 in group A and 3.36 +/- 1.21 in group B ( p=0.877 ) . 
Hypotony with the IOP less than 6 mmHg was found in the first post-operative day in 2 patients in Group A and in 1 in Group B . 
All of them improved spontaneously within a week . 
both triangular and rectangular scleral flaps in trabeculectomy are equally effective in terms of post surgical IOP control , bleb characteristics and complications . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of topical bimatoprost ( LUMIGAN ; Allergan , Inc. , Irvine , CA ) once daily with that of topical combined timolol and dorzolamide ( Cosopt ; Merck and Co , Inc. , Whitehouse Station , NJ ) twice daily . 
Prospective , randomized , double-masked , multicenter clinical trial . 
One hundred seventy-seven patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension and inadequate control of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) after at least 2 weeks of topical timolol maleate 0.5 % monotherapy . 
Patients were randomized to receive bimatoprost 0.03 % once daily ( n = 90 ) or combined timolol 0.5 % and dorzolamide 2 % twice daily ( n = 87 ) over a 3-month period . 
Intraocular pressure , the primary end point , was measured at 8 AM and 10 AM at baseline , week 1 , and months 1 , 2 , and 3 , and also at 4 PM and 8 PM at baseline and month 3 . 
Bimatoprost provided significantly greater IOP lowering compared with combined timolol and dorzolamide . 
At the 8 AM measurements , bimatoprost lowered mean IOP 6.8 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg from baseline , whereas combined timolol and dorzolamide lowered mean IOP 4.4 to 5.0 mmHg from baseline ( P < 0.001 ) . 
At the last follow-up , patients had better diurnal IOP control with bimatoprost than combined timolol and dorzolamide . 
At 8 AM at the 3-month visit , the percentages of patients achieving IOPs of < or =13 mmHg , < or =14 mmHg , < or =15 mmHg , or < or =16 mmHg were more than twice as high for bimatoprost than for combined timolol and dorzolamide ( all P < or =0.008 ) . 
Taste perversion , ocular burning , and stinging with instillation were more common with combined timolol and dorzolamide , whereas conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost . 
In individuals with glaucoma or ocular hypertension , uncontrolled on a topical beta-blocker alone , bimatoprost lowered IOP more consistently than did combined timolol and dorzolamide . 
In a randomized clinical trial , the authors compared the use of postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) in 19 eyes with a single intraoperative application of subconjunctival mitomycin ( MMC ) at the filtering site in 20 eyes at high risk for failure of glaucoma filtering surgery . 
Six months after surgery , intraocular pressures averaged 10.9 +/- 5.3 mmHg ( mean +/- standard deviation ) in the MMC-treated eyes versus 14.2 +/- 5.5 mmHg in the 5-FU-treated eyes ( P = 0.08 ) and were less than or equal to 12 mmHg in 60.0 % of MMC-treated eyes and 21.1 % of 5-FU-treated eyes ( P = 0.03 ) . 
Mitomycin-treated eyes were receiving an average of 0.3 +/- 0.5 medications for intraocular pressure control , and 5-FU-treated eyes were receiving an average of 1.1 +/- 1.1 medications ( P = 0.01 ) . 
Drug-induced corneal epithelial defects were seen in nine 5-FU-treated eyes and in no MMC-treated eyes ( P = 0.0004 ) . 
These results suggest that intraoperative MMC may be a viable alternative to postoperative 5-FU , with lower overall intraocular pressures , decreased dependence on postoperative ocular antihypertensive medications , and decreased corneal toxicity . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -reducing effect and side effects of 0.005 % latanoprost administered once daily with 0.5 % timolol administered twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
This was a randomized , double-masked study with two parallel groups and a treatment period of 6 months . 
The primary objective of the study is to compare the IOP-reducing effect of latanoprost with that of timolol at the end of the 6-month treatment period . 
A total of 294 patients were included : 149 were in the latanoprost group and 145 were in timolol group . 
Latanoprost was administered in the evening . 
Diurnal IOP ( 9:00 am , 1:00 pm , 5:00 pm ) was reduced from 25.2 to 16.7 mmHg ( 33.7 % ) with lantanoprost and from 25.4 to 17.1 mmHg ( 32.7 % ) with timolol as determined at the end of the 6-month treatment period . 
No upward drift in IOP occurred with either drug during the treatment period . 
Latanoprost caused a somewhat more conjunctival hyperemia than timolol and more corneal punctuate epithelial erosions . 
However , both drugs were generally well tolerated . 
The most significant side effect of latanoprost was increased pigmentation of the iris which was observed in 15 patients ( 10.1 % ) . 
Timolol caused more systemic side effects than latanoprost . 
Latanoprost 0.005 % administered once daily in the evening reduced IOP at least as well as timolol 0.5 % administered twice daily . 
Latanoprost was generally well tolerated systemically and in the eye . 
However , the drug has an unusual side effect of increasing the pigmentation of the iris , particularly in individuals with green-brown or blue-brown eyes . 
To evaluate the long-term intraocular pressure ( IOP ) control of trabeculectomy and triple procedure ( cataract extraction by phacoemulsification , intraocular lens implantation and trabeculectomy ) , 1,542 eyes of 900 patients with primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) or chronic primary angle closure glaucoma ( CPACG ) were included . 
When success was defined as an IOP reduction of at least 30 % from baseline , with or without antiglaucoma medications , the overall probability of success of trabeculectomy and triple procedure was 0.613 and 0.733 at 15 years , respectively . 
The success probability of trabeculectomy and triple procedure in reducing IOP below 18 mm Hg was 0.748 and 0.825 at 15 years , respectively . 
In POAG and CPACG patients , trabeculectomy and triple procedure were effective in reducing IOP for up to 15 years after surgery . 
To determine the efficacy and safety of oral clonidine in decreasing the prevalence and intensity of postoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP ) rise in those undergoing phacoemulsification . 
This was a prospective randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , clinical trial including 62 patients ( each with 1 affected aye ) with senile cataract scheduled for phacoemulsification who were randomly assigned to receive preoperative oral clonidine ( 5g/kg , 31 patients ) or placebo ( 1 tablet , 31 patients ) . 
The IOP was measured preoperatively and at 6 , 12 , and 24h postoperatively . 
The prevalence and intensity of the acute postoperative IOP rise was compared between and within the groups . 
There was no significant difference between the 2 study groups regarding the baseline characteristics and the baseline IOP ( P=0.628 ) . 
Patients who received placebo as premedication had significantly higher IOP at 6 ( 17.96±5.49 vs 13.61±4.09 ; P < 0.001 ) and 12 ( 16.90±4.11 vs 13.96±3.25 ; P=0.003 ) h postoperatively compared with those who received oral clonidine . 
However , there was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the IOP at 24h after operation ( 15.41±3.96 vs 16.01±3.41 ; P=0.0539 ) . 
The prevalence of acute IOP rise ( > 21 mmHg ) was significantly higher in placebo group compared with clonidine group ( 25.8 % vs 9.6 % ; P=0.091 ) . 
Administering preoperative oral clonidine in a dosage of 5g/kg , 2h before phacoemulsification , significantly decreases the prevalence and intensity of acute postoperative IOP rise in those undergoing general anesthesia . 
Oral clonidine is safe , cheap , and easily accessible and , thus , it is recommended for controlling the IOP after phacoemulsification , especially in high-risk patients . 
To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of combined trabeculectomy and cataract extraction versus trabeculectomy alone in primary angle-closure glaucoma ( PACG ) . 
Hospital files were retrospectively examined for 99 Chinese PACG patients ; 75 patients underwent combined surgery and 24 underwent trabeculectomy alone . 
Success rates were assessed with the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis . 
The main outcome was the complete success rate defined as either a > 20 % reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) or an IOP that remained below 15 mm Hg , with no medications required . 
Patients in the combined group and trabeculectomy group had a mean follow-up period of 25.8 ( SD 10.8 ) months and 31.4 ( 8.9 ) months , respectively . 
Survival analysis showed that the complete success rate at 3 years was 56 % in the combined group and 54 % in the trabeculectomy group ( p = 0.903 ) . 
There were no significant differences between groups in either IOP or the number of glaucoma medications throughout the 3-year follow-up . 
The incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups ( p = 0.232 ) . 
No additional IOP-lowering surgical procedures were required in the combined group , while 13 ( 54 % ) eyes in the trabeculectomy group required either cataract extraction or further IOP-lowering surgical procedures ( p < 0.001 ) . 
In patients with PACG , the long-term IOP-lowering effect and surgical complications of combined trabeculectomy and cataract extraction are comparable with those of trabeculectomy alone . 
However , the combined surgery incurred fewer subsequent surgical interventions . 
Carteolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity . 
Used topically to reduce intraocular pressure , it is typically applied twice daily . 
In an effort to provide a once-daily dosing regimen , carteolol was formulated with 1 % alginic acid . 
Sodium alginate is a natural polymer product with bioadhesive properties providing increased corneal contact time and a better carteolol penetration through the cornea . 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting 1 % carteolol alginate solution compared to standard 1 % carteolol solution . 
This was a double-masked , parallel group , multicentre study . 
Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma ( n=151 ) were randomly assigned to receive either 1 % carteolol alginate once daily ( AM ) or standard 1 % carteolol solution twice daily for 2 months . 
The masking was maintained through the use of a placebo in the evening for the alginate group . 
Entry into the study required unmedicated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) between 23 mmHg and 32 mmHg at 9 AM and 11 AM . 
Patients using ocular hypotensive medication were required to undergo a washout . 
All patients provided written informed consent . 
Excluded from the study were patients with angle closure , congenital , secondary glaucoma or advanced glaucoma ; any intraocular infection or inflammation , ocular trauma , ocular surgery or laser trabeculoplasty within the previous 3 months ; contraindications to the use of beta adrenoceptor antagonists ; systemic medications likely to modify IOP prescribed or modified during the previous 3 months ; ocular steroid use ; contact lens wear ; and pregnant and lactating women . 
Patients were evaluated at baseline , 15 and 60 days , with IOP measurements at 9 AM and 11 AM . 
At day 15 and day 60 , IOP was measured just before instillation of medication ( 9 AM ) and 2 hours after ( 11 AM ) . 
Slit lamp examinations were performed at each follow-up examination , together with measurement of heart rate and blood pressure ( 10 AM ) and ocular tolerance after medication ( 11 AM ) . 
The primary efficacy criterion was the decrease in IOP from baseline at day 60 for each measurement at 9 AM and 11 AM . 
The study eye was the eye with the higher IOP at day 0 or , if equal , the right eye . 
Efficacy-of the 151 patients included in the study , 149 were evaluated ( two patients were lost to follow-up after day 0 ) : 74 in the alginate group and 75 in the standard group . 
Both treatment groups were comparable at day 0 except for sex , diastolic blood pressure , and IOP in the fellow eye . 
At 09.00 hours ( presumed trough ) on day 60 , mean reductions from baseline in intraocular pressure were 6.32+/-2.87 and 5.67+/-3.30 mmHg for the alginate carteolol and standard groups , respectively . 
At 11.00 hours ( presumed peak ) , mean reductions were 6.70+/-2.81 and 6.55+/-3.35 mmHg , respectively . 
At each evaluation time , the two unilateral t tests were highly significant ( p < 0.005 ) , confirming the equivalence of both treatments . 
Conclusions were not modified taking into account sex and diastolic blood pressure . 
Safety- Slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure means were observed in both groups at follow-up visits with no significant difference between groups . 
Subjective tolerance upon instillation was judged good or very good at day 60 by 100 % of alginate patients and by 98.7 % of standard patients . 
Transient discomfort ( mainly stinging or burning sensation ) was reported by approximately 4 % - 6 % of patients in each treatment group at each visit . 
A blurred vision sensation was reported by 2 out of 74 patients of the alginate group . 
Among the 17 reported adverse events , three were assessed as drug-related : one vertigo , one superficial punctate keratitis in the alginate group and one decrease in blood pressure in the standard group . 
No serious adverse events were reported . 
The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1 % given once daily is as effective as standard 1 % carteolol given twice daily , with no meaningful differences regarding safety . 
This efficacy wasy was verified at 9 AM ( 24 hours after the last drop of long-acting carteolol or 12 hours after that of standard carteolol ) and at 11 AM ( 2 hours after the morning drop ) . 
The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1 % given once a day is effective and well tolerated by glaucoma patients who require chronic treatment . 
To compare the postoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and incidence of early complications after trabeculectomy with releasable suture to standard trabeculectomy in Chinese patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma . 
One hundred seventy-five patients diagnosed as primary angle-closure glaucoma with 6 clock-hours or more of peripheral anterior synechia were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups : 87 underwent standard trabeculectomy ( S group : 2 interrupted permanent sutures to the scleral flap ) and 88 received trabeculectomy with 2 permanent and 2 releasable sutures ( R group ) . 
The postoperative IOP and complications during the first 3 months after surgery were compared . 
One hundred seventy-one patients ( 97.7 % ) attended the 3-month visit . 
The IOP in the first week after trabeculectomy was significantly higher in the R group : day 1 , 17.3 ± 8.6 versus 12.7 ± 6.0 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) ; day 3 , 18.0 ± 7.3 versus 12.9 ± 6.3 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) ; day 7 , 14.8 ± 6.3 versus 12.0 ± 4.9 mm Hg ( P=0.001 ) , but no difference was observed after the second week ( P=0.659 to 0.753 ) . 
The incidence of transient hypotony was higher in S group ( 20.4 % ) than the R group ( 9.1 % ) ( P=0.046 ) ; hypotony recovered in 80.8 % ( 21/26 ) within 1 week . 
There was no difference in the occurrence of shallow chamber , choroidal detachment , macular edema , additional surgery , or hyphema ( P=0.56 to 1.0 ) . 
The technique of releasable sutures for trabeculectomy used in this study did not demonstrate significant advantages over standard trabeculectomy . 
Releasable sutures were associated with some decrease in visual acuity and increase in postoperative complaints . 
The objective of the study was to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of tafluprost 0.0015 % with latanoprost 0.005 % eye drops in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
This double-masked , active-controlled , parallel-group , multinational , multicentre , phase III study was conducted at 49 centres in 8 countries . 
Eligible patients were assigned to treatment administered once daily at 20:00 hrs for up to 24 months . 
Change from baseline intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was the primary efficacy variable . 
Adverse events were recorded and ocular safety was evaluated . 
Both tafluprost and latanoprost were preserved with benzalkonium chloride . 
From 533 patients randomized , 402 patients completed 24 months of therapy . 
Both treatments had a substantial IOP-lowering effect which persisted throughout the study ( -7.1 mmHg for tafluprost and -7.7 mmHg for latanoprost at 24 months ) . 
Although the IOP-lowering effect during the study was slightly larger with latanoprost , this difference was clinically small and the noninferiority of tafluprost to latanoprost over all diurnal IOP measurements was shown with anova and almost reached with ancova ( upper limits of the 95 % confidence intervals 1.38 and 1.52 for the overall period , respectively ) . 
The noninferiority limit was 1.5 mmHg . 
Tafluprost is a new effective and well-tolerated treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension . 
To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost and travoprost on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction in an Egyptian population . 
Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03 % or travoprost 0.004 % once daily . 
IOPs were measured at baseline ; 2 weeks ; and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 months using Goldman applanation tonometery . 
Seventy-two patients were included : 34 and 38 ( P=0.142 ) with a baseline mean IOP 26.52 ± 5.185 and 26.36 ± 1.605 mm Hg ( P=0.629 ) for bimatoprost and travoprost , respectively . 
Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Bimatoprost provided greater ( nonsignificant ) mean IOP reductions from baseline than travoprost at each visit . 
Mean IOP reduction was 8.77 mm Hg ( 33.39 % ) and 8.42 mm Hg ( 31.54 % ) at 2 weeks ( P = 0.703 ) , and 8.47 mm Hg ( 31.61 % ) and 7.84 mm Hg ( 29.50 % ) at 6 months ( P = 0.536 ) for bimatoprost and travoprost , respectively . 
IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 20 ( 58.8 % ) versus 19 ( 50 % ) eyes ( P = 0.603 ) , and 16 mm Hg in 12 ( 35 % ) versus 12 ( 32 % ) eyes ( P = 0.456 ) ; and at 6 months 18 mm Hg in 22 ( 65 % ) versus 14 ( 37 % ) eyes ( P = 0.045 ) , and 16 mm Hg in 12 ( 35 % ) versus 7 ( 18 % ) eyes ( P = 0.037 ) for bimatoprost and travoprost , respectively . 
Ocular adverse and clinical success occurred equally with both drops . 
Both drops lowered IOP effectively but bimatoprost showed a greater non-significant reductions in mean IOP from baseline . 
To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost/timolol ( BTFC ) or travoprost/timolol ( TTFC ) fixed combinations on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction in an Egyptian population . 
Patients with primary open angle glaucoma were randomized to receive either BTFC or TTFC . 
IOPs were measured at baseline , 2 weeks , and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 months . 
The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP from baseline at each visit . 
Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events . 
Eighty patients ( 80 eyes ) were included finally : 40 eyes in each group . 
Baseline mean IOPs were 24.78±3.53 and 25.26±3.51 mm Hg for BTFC and TTFC , respectively ( P=0.344 ) . 
Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits ( P < 0.001 ) . 
BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Mean IOP reductions were 11.34 and 6.42 mm Hg at 2 weeks ( P=0.000 ) , and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at 6 months ( P=0.001 ) for BTFC and TTFC , respectively . 
IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 36 ( 90.8 % ) versus 22 ( 55 % ) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 28 ( 70 % ) versus 16 ( 40 % ) eyes ( P < 0.001 ) , and at 6 months , 18 mm Hg in 38 ( 95 % ) versus 28 ( 70 % ) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 30 ( 75 % ) versus 18 ( 45 % ) eyes for BTFC and TTFC , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Both drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC . 
To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily evening dose of bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination ( BTFC ) with that of a once-daily evening dose of latanoprost/timolol fixed combination ( LTFC ) in patients not controlled with prostaglandins analogues monotherapy . 
A total of 82 patients on prostaglandin analogues monotherapy were enrolled in this prospective , multicenter , investigator masked , clinical study and were randomized to either BTFC ( n=47 ) or LTFC ( n=35 ) topical therapy once at night for 12 weeks . 
The primary endpoint of the study was to compare the mean daily intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction from baseline between the two treatment arms . 
Secondary endpoints included the mean daily IOP at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline and the percentage of patients showing a mean IOP reduction from baseline greater than or equal to 15 % or 20 % . 
Mean IOP at baseline was 22.7+/-2.0 and 22.1+/-2.6 mmHg in the BTFC and LTFC groups , respectively ( p=0.23 ) . 
Both treatments were effective in reducing the IOP from baseline . 
The mean IOP reduction was significantly greater in the BTFC group than in the LTFC group ( -21.4 % vs -13.7 % , p < 0.001 ) . 
A higher percentage of patients in the BTFC group showed a mean IOP reduction from baseline > or=15 % ( 72.3 % vs 40.0 % ) and > or=20 % ( 61.7 % vs 17.1 % ) compared to patients in the LTFC group . 
Both BTFC and LTFC were more effective versus the monotherapy with prostaglandin analogues . 
BTFC demonstrated higher performance than LTFC in terms of relative IOP reduction . 
Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors used to treat glaucoma have significant systemic side effects . 
Brinzolamide 1.0 % , a new topical ocular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , is effective apparently without significant systemic side effects . 
This study was performed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of brinzolamide 1.0 % two and three times daily for primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension . 
An 18-month , multicenter , double-masked , parallel , controlled study was conducted . 
Patients were randomized to brinzolamide two or three times daily or timolol 0.5 % twice daily in a 2:2:1 ratio ( n = 150 , 153 , and 75 , respectively ) . 
Intraocular pressure was measured at 8:00 AM at eligibility and months 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , and 18 . 
Efficacy was based on intraocular pressure reduction from baseline . 
Safety was also evaluated . 
All regimens produced clinically relevant and statistically significant ( P < .05 ) intraocular pressure reductions from baseline . 
Mean changes in intraocular pressure trough measurements ranged from -2.7 to -3.9 mm Hg with brinzolamide twice-daily dosing and -2.8 to -3.8 mm Hg three times daily dosing compared with -4.7 to -5.6 mm Hg with timolol . 
The intraocular pressure reductions with brinzolamide two and three times daily were clinically and statistically equivalent . 
One hundred forty-four patients were discontinued from the study after randomization with the most common reasons being the occurrence of an adverse event ( 46 ) , inadequate intraocular pressure control ( 23 ) , patient decision unrelated to study medication ( 11 ) , lost to follow-up ( 16 ) , and noncompliance ( 9 ) . 
Adverse events were nonserious and resolved without sequelae . 
There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters . 
Brinzolamide produced less ocular discomfort ( burning/stinging ) than timolol , and total carbonic anhydrase inhibition levels remained below that known to cause systemic side effects . 
Brinzolamide produced significant and equivalent reductions in intraocular pressure when dosed two and three times daily for 18 months . 
Brinzolamide was safe and well tolerated by patients , with minimal ocular discomfort . 
To assess the safety and efficacy of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent ( Glaukos Corporation , Laguna Hills , CA ) in combination with cataract surgery in subjects with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma . 
Prospective , randomized , open-label , controlled , multicenter clinical trial . 
A total of 240 eyes with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma with intraocular pressure ( IOP ) =24 mmHg controlled on 1 to 3 medications were randomized to undergo cataract surgery with iStent implantation ( treatment group ) or cataract surgery only ( control ) . 
Fifty additional subjects were enrolled to undergo cataract surgery with iStent implantation under protocol expansion . 
Data in this report are based on the first 240 eyes enrolled . 
Implantation of the iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent in conjunction with cataract surgery or cataract surgery only . 
The primary efficacy measure was unmedicated IOP ≤21 mmHg at 1 year . 
A secondary measure was unmedicated IOP reduction ≥20 % at 1 year . 
Safety measures included best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , slit-lamp observations , complications , and adverse events . 
The study met the primary outcome , with 72 % of treatment eyes versus 50 % of control eyes achieving the criterion ( P < 0.001 ) . 
At 1 year , IOP in both treatment groups was statistically significantly lower from baseline values . 
Sixty-six percent of treatment eyes versus 48 % of control eyes achieved =20 % IOP reduction without medication ( P = 0.003 ) . 
The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between groups with no unanticipated adverse device effects . 
Pressure reduction on fewer medications was clinically and statistically significantly better 1 year after stent plus cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone , with an overall safety profile similar to that of cataract surgery alone . 
Fixed combinations of 0.2 % brimonidine-0.5 % timolol and 2 % dorzolamide-0.5 % timolol are used to lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the IOP-lowering efficacy and ocular tolerability of brimonidine-timolol compared with dorzolamide-timolol when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to a prostaglandin analog ( PGA ) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Pooled data analysis of two randomized , investigator-masked , 3-month , parallel-group studies with identical protocols ( ten sites ) . 
In all , 180 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were in need of lower IOP received topical brimonidine-timolol BID or dorzolamide-timolol BID as monotherapy ( n = 101 ) or as adjunctive therapy to a PGA ( latanoprost , bimatoprost , or travoprost ) ( n = 79 ) . 
IOP was measured at 10 a.m. ( peak effect ) at baseline and at months 1 and 3 . 
Tolerability/comfort was evaluated using a patient questionnaire . 
There were no statistically significant between-group differences in patient demographics . 
Most patients were Caucasian , and the mean age was 68 years . 
There were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in baseline IOP . 
At month 3 , the mean ( SD ) reduction from baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination monotherapy was 7.7 ( 4.2 ) mmHg ( 32.3 % ) with brimonidine-timolol versus 6.7 ( 5.0 ) mmHg ( 26.1 % ) with dorzolamide-timolol ( p = 0.040 ) . 
The mean reduction from PGA-treated baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination adjunctive therapy was 6.9 ( 4.8 ) mmHg ( 29.3 % ) with brimonidine-timolol versus 5.2 ( 3.7 ) mmHg ( 23.5 % ) with dorzolamide-timolol ( p = 0.213 ) . 
Patients on brimonidine-timolol reported less burning ( p < 0.001 ) , stinging ( p < 0.001 ) , and unusual taste ( p < 0.001 ) than patients on dorzolamide-timolol . 
Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol provided the same or greater IOP lowering compared with fixed-combination dorzolamide-timolol . 
Both fixed-combination medications were safe and well-tolerated . 
Brimonidine-timolol received higher ratings of ocular comfort than dorzolamide-timolol . 
The duration of the studies was 3 months , and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine-timolol and dorzolamide-timolol during long-term treatment . 
To test the hypothesis that neodymium : yttrium-aluminum-garnet ( Nd : YAG ) laser peripheral iridotomy ( LPI ) significantly reduces the incidence of conversion from pigment dispersion syndrome ( PDS ) with ocular hypertension ( OHT ) to pigmentary glaucoma ( PG ) . 
Prospective , randomized , controlled 3-year trial . 
One hundred sixteen eyes of 116 patients with PDS and OHT . 
Patients were assigned randomly either to Nd : YAG LPI or to a control group ( no laser ) . 
The primary outcome measure was conversion to PG within 3 years , based on full-threshold visual field ( VF ) analysis using the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study criteria . 
Secondary outcome measures were whether eyes required topical antiglaucoma medications during the study period and the time to conversion or medication . 
Fifty-seven patients were randomized to undergo laser treatment and 59 were randomized to no laser ( controls ) . 
Age , gender , spherical equivalent refraction , and intraocular pressure at baseline were similar between groups . 
Outcome data were available for 105 ( 90 % ) of recruited subjects , 52 in the laser treatment group and 53 in the no laser treatment group . 
Patients were followed up for a median of 35.9 months ( range , 10-36 months ) in the laser arm and 35.9 months ( range , 1-36 months ) in the control arm . 
Eight eyes ( 15 % ) in the laser group and 3 eyes ( 6 % ) in the control group converted to glaucoma in the study period . 
The proportion of eyes started on medical treatment was similar in the 2 groups : 8 eyes ( 15 % ) in the laser group and 9 eyes ( 17 % ) in the control group . 
Survival analyses showed no evidence of any difference in time to VF progression or commencement of topical therapy between the 2 groups . 
Cataract extraction was performed on 1 patient in the laser group and in 1 patient in the control group during the study period ( laser eye at 18 months ; control eye at 34 months ) . 
This study suggests that there was no benefit of Nd : YAG LPI in preventing progression from PDS with OHT to PG within 3 years of follow-up . 
To determine the analgesic effect of supplemental intracameral lidocaine 1 % during phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia , and to assess the risk factors associated with pain . 
In a double-masked , randomised , clinical trial , 506 patients undergoing phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia were randomised to receive a supplemental intracameral injection of either 0.5 cc of 1 % lidocaine ( 277 patients , 54.7 % ) or balanced salt solution ( BSS ) ( 229 patients , 45.3 % ) . 
Patients were interviewed by a trained interviewer using a standardised questionnaire . 
The main outcome measure was intraoperative pain , scored on a visual analogue scale of 0-10 . 
Logistic regression was performed to assess ORs . 
125 of 277 patients ( 45.1 % ) experienced pain in the lidocaine group , compared with 123 of 229 patients ( 53.7 % ) in the BSS group . 
The proportion of patients who experienced pain was significantly lower in the intracameral lidocaine group compared with the BSS group ( multivariate OR 0.68 , 95 % CI 0.47 to 0.97 ; p=0.034 ) . 
The median pain score ( range ) was 0.0 for intracameral lidocaine group compared with 1.0 for BSS group ( p=0.039 ) . 
Pain was more common in females ( 54.3 % vs 43.6 % ; OR 1.56 ) , non-Chinese ( 62.3 % vs 46.9 % ; OR 2.13 ) and those who had previous cataract surgery to the fellow eye ( 55.3 % vs 44.7 % ; OR 1.61 ) . 
The use of 0.5 cc of 1 % intracameral lidocaine during phacoemulsification under topical anaesthesia significantly reduces pain experienced by patients . 
Risk factors for pain include females , non-Chinese and previous cataract surgery . 
Brimonidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist with intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reducing effect . 
We conducted this study in Taiwan to compare the safety and efficacy of brimonidine 0.2 % with timolol 0.5 % for the treatment of glaucoma . 
A prospective , randomized , single-masked , 1-month clinical efficacy and safety trial was conducted from March to September 2000 . 
Forty glaucoma patients were enrolled -- 29 in the brimonidine group and 11 in the timolol group . 
Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 weeks , and were followed at baseline visit , weeks 2 and 4 . 
Demographic data , reduction of IOP , safety and adverse events were obtained and analyzed . 
Both drugs showed sustained ocular hypotensive efficacy in the study period . 
At baseline , the mean IOP was 24.48 +/- 2.29 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 23.32 +/- 0.82 mmHg in the timolol group . 
The IOP readings after treatment were significantly lower than their baseline levels in both groups at all visits ( p < 0.001 ) . 
At peak , the mean decreases from the baseline IOP ranged from 5.22 +/- 0.30 mmHg to 6.96 +/- 0.33 mmHg for brimonidine and from 4.55 +/- 0.49 mmHg to 6.64 +/- 0.53 mmHg for timolol . 
At trough , the mean decreases from baseline ranged from 3.72 +/- 0.32 mmHg to 4.55 +/- 0.32 mmHg for brimonidine and 3.82 +/- 0.52 mmHg to 4.27 +/- 0.51 mmHg for timolol . 
No significant between-group differences were seen at peak or trough at all visits . 
The clinical success rate was 86.2 % in the brimonidine group and 81.8 % in the timolol group , making no statistically significant difference between them ( p = 0.817 ) . 
17.2 % of patients in brimonidine group and 9.0 % patients in timolol group reported mild adverse events . 
Ocular allergy occurred in 10.3 % of patients in brimonidine group . 
No significant changes in visual acuity , biomicroscopy or ophthalmoscopy were observed in both groups . 
Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups except in week 2 ( p = 0.016 ) when brimonidine had lower systolic blood pressure . 
However , brimonidine showed no significant difference in week 4 from baseline . 
The mean heart rate in the brimonidine group was relatively unchanged over the study period . 
Patients receiving timolol experienced statistically significant mean heart rate decreases from baseline ( p = 0.020 ) in week 4 . 
Topically applied twice daily for one month , brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol 0.5 % in Taiwanese patients with glaucoma . 
It has a safe systemic profile with minimum effect on the heart . 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraoperative mitomycin C ( MMC ) in eyes undergoing Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation . 
Randomized controlled clinical trial . 
Sixty patients with refractory glaucoma . 
Sixty eyes of 60 patients with refractory glaucoma were randomized to receive intraoperative MMC ( 0.5 mg/ml for 5 minutes ) ( n = 34 ) or balanced salt solution ( n = 26 ) during Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation . 
Surgical success was defined according to 2 different criteria : ( 1 ) postoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP ) between 6 and 21 mmHg , with or without antiglaucoma medications , and ( 2 ) IOP reduction of at least 30 % relative to preoperative values . 
Eyes requiring additional glaucoma surgery , developing phthisis , or showing loss of light perception were classified as failures . 
Success rates in both groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log rank test . 
Other outcome measures were mean IOP , number of glaucoma medications , and complications . 
After a mean follow-up of 12.3 months , Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a probability of success of 59 % at 18 months for the MMC group and 61 % for the control group when the first criterion for success was used ( IOP between 6 and 21 mmHg ) . 
When an IOP reduction of at least 30 % was used as the criterion to define success , the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a probability of success at 18 months of 62 % for the MMC group and 67 % for the control group . 
There were no significant differences in survival rates between the 2 groups with either criterion ( P = 0.75 and P = 0.37 , respectively ) . 
After 15 days postoperatively , the mean IOP did not significantly differ for both MMC and control eyes . 
Mean numbers of postoperative antiglaucoma medications were similar in MMC-treated eyes and controls . 
There was no significant difference between the incidences of postoperative complications in both groups . 
Mitomycin C did not increase the short- or intermediate-term success rates of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation . 
To compare the efficacy of the fixed dorzolamide 2 % /timolol 0.5 % combination ( COSOPT ) versus latanoprost 0.005 % ( XALATAN ) . 
Two 3-month , parallel group , randomized , observer-masked and patient-masked , multicentre , clinical trials were performed in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma . 
Study 1 ( n=256 ) was conducted in the United States and Study 2 ( n=288 ) was conducted in Europe/Israel . 
Patients could be included whether or not they were currently taking ocular hypotensive therapy , and regardless of the effectiveness of any previous therapy . 
Patients were washed out from their usual ocular hypotensive medications and then those with a baseline intraocular pressure ( IOP ) > /= 24 mmHg were randomized to either the dorzolamide/timolol combination eye drops twice daily or latanoprost eye drops once daily in both eyes . 
Efficacy was assessed by daytime diurnal IOP ( the mean of measurements made at 0800 , 1000 , 1400 and 1600 h ) . 
At baseline , the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 26.1 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 25.6 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 1 , and 25.3 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 24.7 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 2 . 
After 3 months , the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 18.9 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 18.4 mmHg for latanoprost in Study 1 , and 17.4 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 17.5 for latanoprost in Study 2 . 
The difference between treatments in mean IOP change at 3 months was -0.04 mmHg [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) -0.85 , 0.77 ] in Study 1 , and -0.57 mmHg ( 95 % CI -1.31 , 0.16 ) in Study 2 . 
The probability that the true difference lay between -1.5 and 1.5 mmHg , the predefined bounds for equivalence , was > 0.950 in both studies . 
Both treatments were well tolerated over 3 months , although ocular stinging occurred more frequently with the dorzolamide/timolol combination . 
The dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering IOP . 
To compare the safety and efficacy of intraoperative 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) or Intraoperative mitomycin C ( MMC ) in eyes undergoing primary trabeculectomy . 
Prospective double-masked randomized clinical trial . 
One hundred fifteen eyes of 103 patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure ( IOP ) despite maximally tolerated medical therapy or laser were prospectively randomized in a double-masked fashion to one of two treatment groups in a single institution setting . 
Subject 's eyes underwent primary trabeculectomy with either topical 5-FU ( 50 mg/ml for 5 minutes ) or topical MMC ( 0.2 mg/ml for 2 minutes ) . 
Primary outcome measures included the number of eyes achieving target pressures of 21 , 18 , 15 , and 12 mm Hg at 6 and 12 months postoperatively . 
Secondary outcome measures included IOP , best-corrected visual acuity , complications , and interventions . 
Of the 115 eyes , 57 received 5-FU while 58 received MMC . 
A target IOP of 21 mm Hg at 6 months was achieved in 53 of 56 ( 95 % ) eyes in the 5-FU group and 54 of 57 ( 95 % ) eyes in the MMC group ( P = 1.00 ) . 
At 12 months , 45 of 48 ( 94 % ) eyes in the 5-FU group met a target IOP of 21 mm Hg while 48 of 54 ( 89 % ) eyes in the MMC group did ( P =.49 ) . 
The most common complications in each group were persistent choroidal effusions and bleb leak . 
Our study suggests that intraoperative topical 5-FU is at least as effective as intraoperative topical MMC in reducing IOP of eyes undergoing primary trabeculectomy . 
The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to compare the effectiveness and safety of viscocanalostomy ( visco ) with trabeculectomy ( trab ) in the management of primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . 
Patients were randomized to have a viscocanalostomy ( 25 eyes ) or a trabeculectomy ( 25 eyes ) performed by one surgeon ( TDM ) and followed up prospectively . 
Patients were examined preoperatively , at day 1 , day 3 if required , day 6 , week 2 and thereafter as near as possible to 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 54 , and 60 months . 
We recorded intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , presence or absence of any complications , presence and description of any bleb , visual acuity with glasses , and full examinations as routine to monitor any progression of the glaucoma . 
Bleb interventions including needling and antimetabolites were allowed and recorded in both groups . 
YAG laser goniopuncture was allowed in the viscocanalostomy group . 
Mean follow-up was 40 months ( SD 15 ) , with a range from 6 to 60 months . 
Forty-two percent ( n=10 ) of the patients in the trabeculectomy group had a successful outcome ( IOP < 18 mm Hg with no treatment ) at last follow-up visit , compared to 21 % ( n=5 ) in the viscocanalostomy group . 
IOP was lower in the trab group with differences in IOP being statistically significant at month 12 ( P= < 0.001 ) , 24 ( P= < 0.001 ) , 30 ( P=0.030 ) , 36 ( P= < 0.001 ) , and 48 ( P=0.018 ) . 
The trabeculectomy group required less postoperative topical IOP-lowering medication ( P=0.011 ) . 
In this study , we found trabeculectomy to be more effective at lowering IOP than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients . 
To compare the effectiveness and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in adults with uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma . 
Single-masked , parallel-group , prospective , randomized 24-month trial , with 90 % power to detect a clinically important difference between groups . 
Fifty consecutive patients ( 50 eyes ) with primary open-angle or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma . 
Eyes were assigned randomly to either viscocanalostomy ( group 1 ) or trabeculectomy ( group 2 ) with no intraoperative antifibrotics in the study eye . 
In group 1 , no further intervention was allowed , whereas trabeculectomy eyes could receive subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) injections or laser suture lysis after surgery . 
Success rate based on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , visual acuity , discomfort , and other complications . 
At the end of the 24-month follow-up , IOP of 21 mmHg or less and more than 6 mmHg was achieved in 76 % in group 1 ( n = 19 ) and in 80 % in group 2 ( n = 20 ; log-rank P = 0.60 ) ; an IOP between 6 and 16 mmHg was obtained in 56 % in group 1 ( n = 14 ) and in 72 % in group 2 ( n = 18 ; log-rank P = 0.17 ; Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of success ) . 
Complications of viscocanalostomy included one intraoperative conversion into trabeculectomy ; microruptures in Descemet 's membrane in five eyes ; three cases of iris incarceration in the Decemet 's window , two of which caused early failure of the procedure requiring reoperation ; and a 1-mm to 2-mm transient self-resolving hyphema in three cases . 
Complications of trabeculectomy included one case of postoperative bleb bleeding with early transient IOP spike ; one early hyphema ; five cases of postoperative hypotony , two of which had a positive Seidel test from the conjunctival suture ; three cases of transient choroidal detachment , two of which had shallow anterior chamber . 
No patient required reoperation . 
Two eyes required argon laser suture lysis , and nine underwent one or more 5-FU injections , which caused punctate keratopathy in three eyes . 
Viscocanalostomy is an effective IOP-lowering procedure in white adults affected by open-angle glaucoma . 
Trabeculectomy with postoperative 5-FU can probably provides lower IOPs but , with more numerous complications , greater discomfort , and more intensive postoperative management . 
To compare the efficacy of the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve with the Baerveldt 250-mm ( 2 ) Glaucoma Implant in the treatment of adult glaucoma . 
Comparative case series . 
Fifty-nine eyes of 59 patients who received the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve and 133 eyes of 133 patients who received the Baerveldt 250-mm ( 2 ) Glaucoma Implant by the Indiana University Glaucoma Service from 1996 to 2003 . 
Eyes that had previous drainage implant procedures were excluded from both groups . 
If both eyes of a single patient received an implant , the second eye to undergo implantation was excluded from the study . 
Kaplan-Meier survival with success defined as intraocular pressure ( IOP ) > 5 mmHg and < 22 mmHg and at least 20 % reduction from preoperative IOP ( with or without antiglaucoma medications ) and without loss of light perception . 
Secondary outcome measures included intraocular pressure , visual acuity , number of glaucoma medications , and surgical complications . 
The 2 groups were similar with regards to age , gender , race , neovascular glaucoma diagnosis , number of prior ocular surgeries , preoperative IOP , and number of preoperative glaucoma medications . 
Mean durations of follow-up were 20.0 months for Ahmed eyes and 22.9 months for Baerveldt eyes . 
Cumulative successes in the Ahmed group were 0.73 at 1 year and 0.62 at 2 years , whereas cumulative successes in the Baerveldt group were 0.92 at 1 year and 0.85 at 2 years ( Kaplan-Meier survival functions : P = 0.03 , log rank test ) . 
Male gender , African descent , neovascular glaucoma , and Ahmed implantation were found to be significant predictors of failure . 
At last follow-up visit , eyes in the Ahmed group had a significantly higher mean IOP ( 19.8+/-9.5 vs. 15.8+/-7.9 mmHg , P = 0.003 , t test ) and more antiglaucoma medications ( 1.4+/-1.2 vs. 0.9+/-1.1 medications , P = 0.008 , Mann-Whitney test ) than eyes in the Baerveldt group . 
Two methods for avoiding hypotony after Baerveldt 250-mm ( 2 ) implantation had similar outcomes . 
Our study suggests that the Ahmed S2 Glaucoma Valve may be less effective at lowering IOP than the Baerveldt 250-mm ( 2 ) Glaucoma Implant . 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Baerveldt and Ahmed glaucoma drainage implants in Asian patients with refractory glaucoma . 
Retrospective nonrandomized study . 
Forty-one patients . 
The authors reviewed the insertion of 18 Ahmed glaucoma valved ( AGV-S2 ) implants and 24 350 mm ( 2 ) Baerveldt glaucoma implants performed by a single surgeon at the Department of Ophthalmology , National University Hospital , Singapore , from January 1 , 2000 , to December 31 , 2000 . 
A total of 42 glaucoma drainage implants was inserted into the eyes of 41 patients . 
All patients had at least 6 months of follow-up . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , visual acuity , and complications . 
Both drainage implants achieved remarkable reductions in IOP ; from pretreatment IOP of 40.1+/-13.8 mmHg and 43.7+/-9.3 mmHg to postoperative IOP of 17.4+/-6.2 and 14.9+/-5.5 mmHg in the Baerveldt and Ahmed groups , respectively . 
A decrease in IOP of 56.6 % and 65.9 % had been achieved . 
Success rates were 20 ( 83.3 % ) for Baerveldt and 12 ( 66.7 % ) for Ahmed implants , whereas qualified success occurred in 1 ( 4.2 % ) Baerveldt and 3 ( 16.7 % ) Ahmed implants . 
Conversely , failure to control IOP occurred in 3 ( 12.5 % ) Baerveldt implants and 3 ( 16.7 % ) Ahmed implants . 
More than 80 % of the patients had maintained or improved visual function , whereas only 4 ( 16.0 % ) of the patients with Baerveldt implants and 2 ( 16.7 % ) patients with Ahmed implants had loss of more than 1 Snellen line . 
Both Baerveldt and Ahmed glaucoma drainage implants performed well in terms of IOP control , preservation of visual function , and having low complication rates . 
To report the longer term results of a randomized , clinical trial comparing the 350-mm2 and the 500-mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implants . 
Extended follow-up on a randomized , controlled trial . 
Between March 1991 and April 1993 , 107 patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure ( IOP ) due to non-neovascular glaucoma associated with aphakia , pseudophakia , or failed filters were randomly assigned for surgical placement of either the 350-mm2 or the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant at the Doheny Eye Institute . 
A random-numbers table was used to assign each patient to one of the two groups . 
Preoperative IOPs and visual acuities were recorded . 
Clinical records were reviewed to ascertain postoperative IOPs , visual acuities , number of medications used , and implant-related complications that occurred throughout the follow-up period . 
Success was defined as IOP of 6 mmHg or greater and of 21 mmHg or less in two or more consecutive follow-up visits without further glaucoma surgery or loss of light perception attributable to glaucoma . 
The overall success rates were 87 % for the 350-mm2 group and 70 % for the 500-mm2 group ( P = 0.05 ) . 
Average follow-up was 37 months ( range , 1-76 months ) for the 350-mm2 group and 34 months ( range , 5-77 months ) for the 500-mm2 group . 
The life-table success rates declined over time for both implant groups , from a high of 98 % for the 350-mm2 group and 92 % for the 500-mm2 group at 1 year to a cumulative success rate of 79 % for the 350-mm2 group and 66 % for the 500-mm2 group at 5 years . 
Visual acuities were better or remained the same in 50 % of the patients in the 350-mm2 group and 46 % of those in the 500-mm2 group . 
Complications during the 5-year follow-up were also statistically similar . 
The longer term results show that the 350-mm2 Baerveldt implant is more successful than the 500-mm2 implant for overall IOP control . 
Interval comparisons indicate a higher rate of success for the 350-mm2 implant in the first , second , third , fourth , and fifth years of implantation . 
Visual acuities , implant-related complications , and average IOPs were statistically indistinguishable between the two groups . 
To determine whether treatment with betaxolol can delay or prevent the conversion from ocular hypertension to early glaucoma on the basis of visual field criteria , by means of a prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled trial . 
Three hundred and fifty-six ocular hypertensives were randomized to treatment with either betaxolol drops or placebo drops during the period 1992-1996 . 
Each patient was followed prospectively with 4-monthly visits . 
Examination at each visit included visual field testing , intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) measurement and optic disc imaging . 
Conversion to early glaucoma was defined on the basis of visual field change by AGIS criteria . 
An intent-to-treat analysis compared visual field conversion after 3 years in the treatment and placebo arms . 
Normal visual field survival analysis was also performed . 
The IOP characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared . 
Two hundred and fifty-five patients completed the study , which ended in 1998 , with a range of follow-up of 2-6 years . 
Sixteen ( 13.2 % ) of 121 patients in the placebo group converted to glaucoma , compared with 12 ( 9.0 % ) of 134 patients in the betaxolol group . 
The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated no evidence of any difference in conversion rates between the betaxolol and placebo groups after 3 years . 
Visual field survival analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the betaxolol and placebo groups . 
The betaxolol-treated group had significantly lower post-treatment IOP values . 
Converters had significantly higher pre- and post-treatment IOP values than non-converters . 
Betaxolol significantly lowered the IOP level compared with placebo . 
Conversion to glaucoma was found to be related to both the baseline and post-treatment IOP levels . 
However the intent-to-treat analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the conversion rate in the betaxolol-treated group . 
To compare phacoemulsification alone versus combined phacotrabeculectomy in medically uncontrolled chronic angle closure glaucoma ( CACG ) with coexisting cataract . 
Prospective randomized clinical trial . 
Fifty-one medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract of 51 patients . 
Recruited patients were randomized into group 1 ( phacoemulsification alone ) or group 2 ( combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C ) . 
Postoperatively , patients were reviewed every 3 months for 2 years . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and requirement for topical glaucoma drugs . 
Twenty-seven CACG eyes were randomized into group 1 , and 24 CACG eyes were randomized into group 2 . 
Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in lower mean postoperative IOP than phacoemulsification alone at 3 months ( 14.0 vs 17.0 mmHg , P = 0.01 ) , 15 months ( 13.2 vs 15.4 mmHg , P = 0.02 ) , and 18 months ( 13.6 vs 15.9 mmHg , P = 0.01 ) . 
Combined phacotrabeculectomy resulted in 1.25 fewer topical glaucoma drugs ( P < 0.001 ) in the 24-month postoperative period , compared with phacoemulsification alone . 
Combined surgery was associated with more postoperative complications ( P < 0.001 ) and more progression of optic neuropathy ( P = 0.03 ) , compared with phacoemulsification alone . 
Combined phacotrabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C is more effective than phacoemulsification alone in controlling IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes with coexisting cataract . 
Combined phacotrabeculectomy is associated with more postoperative complications . 
To compare the additional intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost 0.005 % administered once daily with that of pilocarpine 2 % administered three times daily in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5 % twice daily . 
In a 6-month , multicenter , randomized , open-label study 242 patients with POAG or OH whose IOP was not controlled with timolol 0.5 % b.i.d . 
were enrolled . 
Eyes had not been treated with pilocarpine and latanoprost for at least 2 years . 
An analysis of covariance with diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 for study eyes was performed . 
Four patients on latanoprost 0.005 % and 35 on pilocarpine 2 % did not complete the study ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Two hundred and forty patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis . 
For both treatments the diurnal IOP reduction after 6 months was statistically significant ( P < 0.001 ) . 
IOP ( mean+/-SD ) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to 17.8+/-2.8 ( -5.6 ) mmHg in the latanoprost 0.005 % group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to 18.5+/-2.4 ( -4.8 ) mmHg in pilocarpine 2 % t.i.d.-treated eyes . 
The mean difference of -0.8 mmHg ( per protocol , PP ) and -1.6 mmHg ( intend-to-treat , ITT ) was statistically significant ( P < 0.04 , PP ; P < 0.001 , ITT ) in favor of latanoprost 0.005 % . 
Two eyes treated with latanoprost showed an iris color change . 
Thirty-six patients in the latanoprost group and 106 in the pilocarpine 2 % group reported ocular adverse events ( P < 0.001 ) . 
From the data we conclude that the additivity of latanoprost 0.005 % is at least as effective as pilocarpine 2 % t.i.d . in reducing IOP when added to eyes currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5 % b.i.d . 
Latanoprost was better tolerated than pilocarpine 2 % eye drops in this study . 
The increase in iris pigmentation requires further investigation . 
The Baerveldt glaucoma implant is a large equatorial aqueous shunting device that is installed through a single-quadrant conjunctival incision . 
The intermediate-term results of a randomized study comparing the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants are reported . 
Seventy-three patients with medically uncontrollable , nonneovascular glaucomas associated with aphakia , pseudophakia , or failed filters were enrolled in a randomized , prospective study comparing 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants . 
Surgical success was defined as 6 mmHg < or = final intraocular pressure < or = 21 mmHg without glaucoma reoperation or devastating complication . 
Of patients with 350- and 500-mm2 implants , 93 % and 88 % , respectively , achieved surgical success ( 18-month life-table analysis , P = 0.93 ) . 
The 500-mm2 implants afforded intraocular pressure control with significantly fewer medications ( 0.7 versus 1.3 ; P = 0.006 ) . 
The postoperative visual acuities remained within one line of the preoperative visual acuities or improved in 62 % and 66 % of patients in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups , respectively ( P = 0.93 ) . 
Complication rates were statistically similar . 
The most frequent ones in the 350- and 500-mm2 groups , respectively , were serous choroidal effusion ( 16 % and 32 % ) , strabismus ( 16 % and 19 % ) , anterior uveitis ( 14 % and 11 % ) , and corneal or corneal graft edema ( 11 % each ) . 
The intermediate-term results of the 350- and 500-mm2 Baerveldt implants were statistically comparable with respect to surgical and visual outcomes , as well as complications , although the larger implant was associated with a higher rate of some complications . 
However , the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant afforded intraocular pressure control with fewer medications than the 350-mm2 implant . 
To evaluate the additive intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering efficacy and safety of fixed combination brimonidine 0.2 % /timolol 0.5 % compared with timolol 0.5 % at peak and trough effect when used as therapy adjunctive to latanoprost 0.005 % in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who require additional IOP lowering . 
In this prospective , randomized , multicenter , investigator-masked , parallel-group study , patients were treated with latanoprost monotherapy for at least four weeks prior to baseline . 
At baseline on latanoprost , patients with IOP 21 mmHg in at least one eye were randomized to twice-daily fixed brimonidine-timolol ( n = 102 ) or timolol ( n = 102 ) , each adjunctive to latanoprost for 12 weeks . 
IOP was measured at 8 am and 10 am at baseline , week 6 , and week 12 and evaluated in the per protocol population . 
The primary efficacy endpoint was peak IOP lowering at 10 am , week 12 . 
Safety measures included adverse events . 
Baseline mean IOP was similar at 10 am in the treatment groups ( brimonidine-timolol 23.4 mmHg ; timolol 23.0 mmHg ) . 
The mean additional reduction from latanoprost-treated baseline IOP was 8.3 mmHg ( 35.5 % ) with fixed brimonidine-timolol and 6.2 mmHg ( 27.0 % ) with timolol at 10 am , week 12 ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Patients treated with fixed brimonidine-timolol adjunctive to latanoprost were significantly more likely than patients treated with adjunctive timolol to achieve an IOP < 18 mmHg ( P = 0.028 ) and a 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline ( P = 0.047 ) at both 8 am and 10 am in week 12 . 
Adverse events occurred in 14.7 % of fixed brimonidine-timolol patients and 12.7 % of timolol patients . 
Biomicroscopy findings were similar between the treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment . 
Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol reduced IOP significantly more effectively than timolol when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension . 
Both fixed brimonidine-timolol and timolol were well tolerated as agents adjunctive to latanoprost . 
To evaluate the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2 % -timolol 0.5 % compared with latanoprost 0.005 % in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
This was a prospective , randomized , multicenter , investigator-masked clinical trial . 
After washout of any previous IOP-lowering medications , patients with IOP of 24 mmHg or higher were randomized to twice-daily fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2 % -timolol 0.5 % ( n = 73 ) or once-daily latanoprost 0.005 % ( n = 75 , dosed in the evening , with vehicle control in the morning to maintain masking ) for 12 weeks . 
IOP was measured at 8 a.m. ( before dosing ) , 10 a.m. , and 3 p.m. at baseline , week 6 , and week 12 . 
The primary efficacy endpoint was diurnal IOP ( averaged over 8 a.m. , 10 a.m. , and 3 p.m. ) at week 12 . 
Safety measures included biomicroscopy . 
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in mean diurnal IOP at baseline ( p = 0.118 ) . 
At week 12 , the mean ( SD ) diurnal IOP was 17.8 ( 2.9 ) mmHg with brimonidine-timolol and 17.9 ( 3.9 ) mmHg with latanoprost ( p = 0.794 ) . 
The percentage of patients achieving at least a 20 % decrease from baseline diurnal IOP at week 12 was 87.7 % in the brimonidine-timolol group and 77.3 % in the latanoprost group ( p = 0.131 ) . 
Measured biomicroscopic changes from baseline to week 12 were infrequent in both groups . 
Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol was as effective as latanoprost in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Both treatments demonstrated favorable ocular tolerability . 
The duration of the study was 12 weeks , and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol and latanoprost during long-term treatment . 
To compare the efficacy of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) control of the Baerveldt-350 implant with tube ligature and the Ahmed valve in patients with refractory glaucoma . 
Four hundred seventy glaucoma drainage device procedures from July 1995 to July 2001 ( 6 years ) were reviewed retrospectively . 
Thirty-two cases of Baerveldt-350 implantation performed in patients with glaucoma refractory to medical treatment and filtering procedures , without previous drainage device or cyclodestructive procedures , and with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were identified . 
Thirty-two cases of Ahmed valve implantation were matched case by case with 32 Baerveldt-350 cases for age , race , gender , glaucoma subtype , previous ocular history , preoperative IOP , and surgeon who performed the implantation . 
The two groups were compared for IOP control , visual outcome , complication rate , and surgical success rate . 
Surgical success rate was defined as an IOP reduction greater than or equal to 30 % and final IOP more than 5 mm Hg and less than 22 mm Hg , without devastating complications . 
Over a follow-up period of 1 year , no statistically significant differences were detected between the Baerveldt-350 implant versus Ahmed valve for IOP control ( 12.1 +/- 5.3 mm Hg vs 13.6 +/- 5.6 mm Hg respectively , at a power of 90 % to detect a difference of 3.2 mm Hg between the two groups and P = 0.05 ) , surgical success rate ( 65.6 % vs. 65.6 % respectively , complete and qualified combined ) , postoperative hypotony rate ( 37.5 % vs. 34.4 % respectively ) , and visual acuity changes of more than 1 line in Snellen visual acuity ( 43.3 % vs. 29.0 % respectively ) . 
In a case-controlled comparison , the Baerveldt-350 implant and the Ahmed valve had similar IOP control and surgical outcomes in patients with refractory glaucoma at 1-year follow-up . 
To compare the IOP-lowering efficacy of a.m.-dosed travoprost and latanoprost at 24-h post-dose . 
Open-angle glaucoma patients not naïve to prostaglandin therapy and currently controlled on p.m.-dosed ( 2100 ) latanoprost ( n = 21 ) or travoprost ( n = 30 ) had baseline IOPs measured at 0900 . 
In a randomized , single-masked , crossover design , patients received travoprost ( Travatan † ) or latanoprost ( Xalatan ‡ ) at 0900 for 4 weeks , then were crossed over to receive the second prostaglandin for another 4 weeks . 
Treatment IOP was measured at 0900 prior to morning dose at both 4 and 8 week visits . 
Patient dosing preference ( a.m./p.m . ) 
was surveyed on exit . 
Main outcome measure : Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . 
† Travatan is a registered trade name of Alcon Laboratories , Inc. , Fort Worth , TX , USA ‡ Xalatan is a registered trade name of Pfizer , New York , NY , USA . 
The mean IOP in the first period when all patients were dosed in the evening was assessed 12 h after dosing at 09:00 and it was similar in the two treatment groups ( mean +/- standard deviation : 17.9 +/- 2.7 mmHg for travoprost versus 17.7 +/- 2.5 mmHg for latanoprost , p = 0.812 ) . 
In the a.m.-dosing crossover comparison , the 24-h post-dose IOP was significantly lower ( p < 0.001 ) on travoprost ( 16.9 +/- 3.1 mmHg ) compared to latanoprost ( 18.6 +/- 3.3 mmHg ) . 
In the exit survey , 51 % of patients preferred a.m.-dosing . 
a.m.-dosed travoprost is superior to a.m.-dosed latanoprost by 1.7 mmHg at 24-h post-dose . 
To assess the efficacy and safety of fixed-combination latanoprost-timolol ( FCLT ) vs latanoprost or timolol monotherapy . 
This 12-week , randomized , double-masked , parallel-group study included patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension treated with a beta-blocker and with baseline intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of 26 through 36 mm Hg . 
Following washout , eligible patients were randomized to once-daily FCLT in the evening , latanoprost in the evening , or timolol in the morning . 
Postbaseline IOP assessments at 8 am , 10 am , and 4 pm at weeks 2 , 6 , and 12 ; statistical superiority of FCLT for the 18 pairwise comparisons between FCLT and the 2 monotherapies , using analysis of variance . 
All therapies resulted in significant IOP reductions from baseline . 
Pairwise comparisons favored FCLT at all time points . 
When the 18 comparisons were tested simultaneously , FCLT was statistically superior to latanoprost at 7 of 9 time points and at all 9 time points when compared with timolol . 
In addition , FCLT was associated with greater percentage reductions in diurnal IOP levels and a greater likelihood of achieving lower mean diurnal IOP levels . 
Diurnal IOP reductions of 30 % or more from baseline to week 12 were achieved by 73.5 % , 57.5 % , and 32.8 % of those treated with FCLT , latanoprost , and timolol , respectively ( P = .007 for FCLT vs timolol ; P < .001 for FCLT vs latanoprost ) . 
All therapies were well tolerated . 
Fixed-combination latanoprost-timolol therapy is as safe and effective in lowering IOP in patients with either ocular hypertension or glaucoma as monotherapy with latanoprost or timolol . 
Combination therapy can be used to treat patients for whom monotherapy does not provide sufficient IOP reduction . 
The simplicity , efficacy , and tolerability of FCLT contribute to its utility in clinical practice . 
To determine the effect of scleral flap size on the medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication rates after augmented trabeculectomy . 
Prospective randomized clinical trial . 
Glaucoma patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy . 
Exclusion criteria included previous ocular surgery apart from cataract surgery , secondary glaucoma and age under 18 . 
Patients were randomized to either standard trabeculectomy ( 4 × 4 mm scleral flap ) or microtrabeculectomy ( 2 × 2 mm scleral flap ) , both with adjustable sutures and antimetabolites . 
Bleb needling was performed as required . 
Patients were evaluated at day 1 , weeks 1 , 3 , 6 and months 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 postoperatively . 
Vision , intraocular pressure , complications and failure ( intraocular pressure ≥ 21 mmHg or not reduced by ≥20 % from baseline , intraocular pressure ≤ 5 mmHg , repeat glaucoma surgery and no light perception vision ) . 
Forty-one patients were recruited ; 20 had standard trabeculectomy , and 21 had microtrabeculectomy . 
At 2 years , the mean intraocular pressure and cumulative probability of failure was 12.4 ± 4.6 mmHg and 0.28 for standard trabeculectomy , and 11.5 ± 3.6 mmHg and 0.27 for microtrabeculectomy ( P = 0.50 and 0.89 , respectively ) . 
One patient in each group required Baerveldt device implantation . 
Vision reduced ≥2 Snellen lines in 15 % in the standard trabeculectomy group and 25 % in the microtrabeculectomy group , mainly from cataract ( P = 0.48 ) . 
Both trabeculectomy techniques achieved good intraocular pressure reduction and had similar complication rates . 
Scleral flap size had no significant effect on medium-term intraocular pressure control and complication profile . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of tafluprost , a preservative-free ( PF ) prostaglandin analogue , with PF timolol in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Randomized , double-masked , multicenter clinical trial . 
After discontinuation and washout of existing ocular hypotensive treatment , patients who had intraocular pressure ( IOP ) =23 and =36 mm Hg in at least 1 eye at the 08:00 hour time point were randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of treatment with either PF tafluprost 0.0015 % or PF timolol 0.5 % . 
IOP was measured 3 times during the day ( 08:00 , 10:00 , 16:00 hours ) at baseline and at weeks 2 , 6 , and 12 . 
It was hypothesized that PF tafluprost would be noninferior to PF timolol over 12 weeks with regard to change from baseline IOP . 
The trial was powered for a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mm Hg at each of the 9 time points assessed . 
A total of 643 patients were randomized and 618 completed ( PF tafluprost = 306 , PF timolol = 312 ) . 
IOPs at the 3 time points assessed during the baseline visit ranged from 23.8 to 26.1 mm Hg in the PF tafluprost group and 23.5 to 26.0 mm Hg in the PF timolol group . 
IOPs at the 3 time points assessed during the 12-week visit ranged from 17.4 to 18.6 mm Hg for PF tafluprost and 17.9 to 18.5 mm Hg for PF timolol . 
At all 9 time points , the upper limits of the 2-sided 95 % confidence intervals for the difference between treatments in IOP lowering were less than the prespecified noninferiority margin . 
Similar percentages of PF tafluprost and PF timolol patients reported ocular pain/stinging/irritation ( 4.4 % vs 4.6 % ) and pruritus ( 2.5 % vs 1.5 % ) . 
The percentages of PF tafluprost and PF timolol patients reporting conjunctival hyperemia were 4.4 % vs 1.2 % ( nominal P = .016 ) . 
The IOP-lowering effect of PF tafluprost was noninferior to that of PF timolol . 
PF tafluprost is an efficacious and generally well-tolerated ocular hypotensive agent . 
To report one-year results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( TVT ) Study . 
Multicenter randomized clinical trial . 
Setting : 17 Clinical Centers . 
Study Population : Patients 18 to 85 years of age who had previous trabeculectomy and/or cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation and uncontrolled glaucoma with intraocular pressure ( IOP ) > or =18 mm Hg and < or =40 mm Hg on maximum tolerated medical therapy . 
Interventions : 350 mm ( 2 ) Baerveldt glaucoma implant or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C ( MMC ) . 
Main Outcome Measures : IOP , visual acuity , and reoperation for glaucoma . 
A total of 212 eyes of 212 patients were enrolled , including 107 in the tube group and 105 in the trabeculectomy group . 
At one year , IOP ( mean +/- SD ) was 12.4 +/- 3.9 mm Hg in the tube group and 12.7 +/- 5.8 mm Hg in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .73 ) . 
The number of glaucoma medications ( mean +/- SD ) was 1.3 +/- 1.3 in the tube group and 0.5 +/- 0.9 in the trabeculectomy group ( P < .001 ) . 
The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 3.9 % in the tube group and 13.5 % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = .017 ) . 
Nonvalved tube shunt surgery was more likely to maintain IOP control and avoid persistent hypotony or reoperation for glaucoma than trabeculectomy with MMC during the first year of follow-up in the TVT Study . 
Both surgical procedures produced similar IOP reduction at one year , but there was less need for supplemental medical therapy following trabeculectomy with MMC . 
The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and complications of trabeculectomy with a biodegradable implant ( ologen implant ) vs trabeculectomy using mitomycin C ( MMC ) in patients with medically uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma in a prospective randomised clinical trial . 
In the MMC group ( 10 patients ) , trabeculectomy was performed according to standard protocols . 
In the ologen group ( 10 patients ) after standard trabeculectomy the implant was positioned on top of the scleral flap and no MMC was applied . 
Follow-up was continued for 12 months after surgery and included testing of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , visual acuity , visual field , ultrasound biomicroscopy , and filtering bleb score . 
The mean preoperative IOP was 24.8+/-8.9 mm Hg for all patients enrolled . 
At 1 year after surgery , the mean IOP was 15.6+/-2.4mm Hg in the ologen group ( P < 0.01 , 43 % reduction ) and 11.5+/-4.1 mm Hg in the MMC group ( P < 0.01 , 50 % reduction ) . 
No anti-glaucomatous medication was necessary in the MMC group in the first year of follow-up , whereas five patients in the ologen group required topical treatment . 
The absolute success rate was 100 % in the MMC group and 50 % in the ologen group ( P=0.01 ) . 
After 1 year , filtering blebs developed significantly more avascular areas in the MMC group ( score=1.4 ) than in the ologen group ( score=2.8 ; P < 0.01 ) . 
The complete success rate using trabeculectomy with the ologen implant is lower than that achieved by trabeculectomy with MMC . 
However , the bleb morphology caused more problems in the MMC group ( avascularity score ) . 
To compare the effect on intraocular pressure of latanoprost versus timolol plus dorzolamide in open-angle glaucoma . 
Thirty-five patients with open-angle glaucoma were randomized , 18 to latanoprost once daily and 17 to timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily . 
Intraocular pressure and ocular side effects were recorded at baseline , and after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment . 
Latanoprost reduced the intraocular pressure 1.09 and 1.58 mm Hg more than timolol plus dorzolamide after 2 weeks and 3 months of treatment , respectively . 
These differences were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) at the end of the study . 
After 3 months of treatment , 32.3 % of the eyes in the latanoprost group reduced the intraocular pressure in 30 % or more with respect to baseline , while 15.6 % of the eyes in the timolol plus dorzolamide group achieved this reduction . 
Latanoprost administered once daily reduced the intraocular pressure at least as well as timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma . 
To compare intraocular pressure ( IOP ) control and other clinical outcomes after 1-site fornix-based and 2-site limbus-based phacotrabeculectomy . 
Prospective randomized controlled trial . 
A total of 90 eyes of 76 patients with cataract and glaucoma were treated . 
Forty-four eyes were assigned randomly to receive a 1-site phacotrabeculectomy with a fornix-based conjunctival flap , and 46 eyes were assigned randomly to receive a 2-site phacotrabeculectomy with a limbus-based conjunctival flap . 
All operations were performed with mitomycin C . 
Intraocular pressure and number of antiglaucoma medications were recorded at baseline and during a 3-year follow-up period . 
Mean preoperative IOP was 20.1+/-3.8 mmHg in the 1-site group and 19.5+/-5.3 mmHg in the 2-site group ( P = 0.56 ) using a mean of 2.3+/-0.9 and 2.5+/-0.9 antiglaucoma medications , respectively ( P = 0.27 ) . 
After 3 years of follow-up , the mean IOP was 12.6+/-4.8 mmHg in the 1-site group and 11.7+/-4.0 mmHg in the 2-site group ( P = 0.40 ) , receiving a mean of 0.3+/-0.7 and 0.4+/-0.9 medications , respectively ( P = 0.59 ) . 
At the end of the study , 73 % of 1-site eyes and 78.4 % of 2-site eyes had IOPs of less than 18 mmHg while receiving no antiglaucoma medications ( P = 0.59 ) . 
Visual acuity was similar for both groups at 3 months after surgery . 
There were no significant differences in the need for digital pressure , postoperative bleb needling with 5-fluorouracil , or number of postoperative visits . 
There were 2 major complications in each group during follow-up . 
Early leaks of the conjunctival wound closure occurred in 6 eyes in the 1-site group and in 0 eyes in the 2-site group ( P = 0.03 ) . 
Operating time ( in minutes ) was less in the 1-site surgery group ( P < 0.0001 ) . 
Day one postoperative IOP was higher in the 2-site group ( P = 0.0.01 ) . 
One-site fornix-based and 2-site limbus-based phacotrabeculectomy were similarly effective in lowering IOP and reducing the need for antiglaucoma medications over a 3-year follow-up period . 
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine purite 0.1 % in comparison to brinzolamide 1 % when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost 0.005 % in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Randomized , single-center , investigator-masked , parallel-group clinical study . 
Patients with IOP > or= 18 mmHg while on once-daily latanoprost were randomized to adjunctive treatment with brimonidine purite TID ( n = 20 ) or brinzolamide TID ( n = 20 ) for 3 months . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was measured at 8 a.m. , 10 a.m. , and 4 p.m. at latanoprost-treated baseline and after 1 and 3 months of latanoprost and adjunctive therapy . 
A patient questionnaire was administered to evaluate the tolerability of eye drop instillation . 
Baseline mean diurnal IOP ( +/- standard deviation , mmHg ) on latanoprost was comparable between groups ( brimonidine purite : 19.6 +/- 2.94 ; brinzolamide : 19.8 +/- 3.25 ; p = 0.846 ) . 
Mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 was 16.3 +/- 2.63 mmHg with brimonidine purite and 17.8 +/- 2.19 mmHg with brinzolamide ( p = 0.028 ) . 
Adjunctive use of brimonidine purite provided greater IOP lowering than brinzolamide at 10 a.m. ( p < 0.001 ) and 4 p.m. ( p = 0.050 ) and equivalent IOP lowering to brinzolamide at 8 a.m. ( p = 0.716 ) . 
Blurred vision at Month 1 and bitter taste at Months 1 and 3 were more common upon instillation of brinzolamide eye drops . 
Brimonidine purite 0.1 % provided significantly lower IOP compared with brinzolamide 1 % when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost . 
Both adjunctive therapies were well tolerated . 
Limitations of this study include the use of a single site and the sample size . 
Additional studies are needed to further evaluate these drugs as adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs . 
Ocular blood flow dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma . 
Whereas the effect of single antiglaucoma substances on ocular blood flow has been addressed in various experiments , evidence for fixed combinations is sparse . 
In the present study , we set out to compare the effects of latanoprost 0.005 % /timolol 0.5 % ( LT ) fixed combination and brimonidine 0.2 % /timolol 0.5 % ( BT ) fixed combination on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and ocular blood flow . 
In the present study , which followed a randomized , double-masked 2-way crossover design , 16 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 2 patients with ocular hypertension were included . 
The patients underwent a 6-week treatment with LT and a 6-week treatment with BT after a washout for previous antiglaucoma medication . 
Optic nerve head blood flow ( ONHBF ) was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry ; retrobulbar flow velocities were measured using color Doppler imaging in the ophthalmic artery , the central retinal artery , and the posterior ciliary arteries . 
IOP was measured at 8 AM , 12 PM , and 4 PM . 
The mean baseline IOP was 25.3 ±2.8 mmHg . 
Both drugs were equally effective in reducing IOP ( LT : -35.0 % ±10.0 % ; BT : -33.6 % ±8.8 % , P=0.463 between groups ) . 
In addition , no difference in ocular perfusion pressure was observed between the 2 treatment groups ( P=0.1 , between groups ) . 
Neither LT nor BT altered ONHBF ( P=0.4 , baseline vs. treatment ) and no effect on flow velocities in the retrobulbar vessels was seen with either of the 2 treatments . 
In the present study , a 6-week treatment with LT or BT was equally effective in reducing IOP . 
In addition , none of the administered drugs induced a significant effect on ocular blood flow parameters . 
Bimatoprost and the fixed combination of latanoprost with timolol maleate are 2 medications widely used to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension ( OHT ) . 
The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of these 2 drugs in reducing intraocular pressure ( IOP ) after 8 weeks of treatment in patients with primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) or OHT . 
In this randomized , open-label trial , 44 patients with POAG or OHT were allocated to receive either bimatoprost ( 1 drop QD ) or latanoprost/timolol ( 1 drop QD ) . 
Primary outcome was the mean diurnal IOP measurement at the 8th week , calculated as the mean IOP measurements taken at 8:00 am , 10:00 am , and 12:00 pm Secondary outcomes included the baseline change in IOP measured 3 times a day , after the water-drinking test ( performed after the last IOP measurement ) , and the assessment of side effects of each therapy . 
The mean IOP levels of latanoprost/timolol ( 13.83 , SD = 2.54 ) was significantly lower than of bimatoprost ( 16.16 , SD = 3.28 ; P < 0.0001 ) at week 8 . 
Also , the change in mean IOP values was significantly higher in the latanoprost/timolol group at 10:00 am ( P = 0.013 ) and 12:00 pm ( P = 0.01 ) , but not at 8:00 am ( P = ns ) . 
During the water-drinking test , there was no significant difference in IOP increase ( absolute and percentage ) between groups ; however , there was a significant decrease in mean heart rate in the latanoprost/timolol group . 
Finally , no significant changes in blood pressure and lung spirometry were observed in either groups . 
The fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol was significantly superior to bimatoprost alone in reducing IOP in patients with POAG or OHT . 
Further studies with large sample sizes should be taken to support the superior efficacy of latanoprost/timolol , as well as to better assess its profile of side effects . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of laser peripheral iridotomy with or without laser peripheral iridoplasty in the treatment of eyes with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle-closure glaucoma . 
Randomized , controlled clinical trial . 
Consecutive patients older than 40 years with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle closure glaucoma were recruited . 
Eligible patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment options , iridotomy or iridotomy plus iridoplasty , and were followed up for 1 year . 
Main outcome measures were intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , peripheral anterior synechiae , corneal endothelial cell count , and complications . 
Seventy-seven eyes ( 77 patients ) were randomized to the iridotomy group , and 81 eyes ( 81 patients ) were randomized to the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group . 
Sixty-one patients ( 79.2 % ) in the iridotomy and 65 patients ( 80.2 % ) from the iridotomy plus iridoplasty groups completed 1 year of follow-up . 
There were no significant differences between the groups in the baseline data . 
IOP was reduced from 24.66 +/- 13.76 mm Hg to 19.03 +/- 6.21 mm Hg in the iridotomy group ( P < .001 ) and from 27.96 +/- 13.06 mm Hg to 20.45 +/- 7.26 mm Hg in the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group ( P < .001 ) . 
Extent of peripheral anterior synechiae was decreased by 1 more clock-hour after iridoplasty compared with that after iridotomy in the iridotomy plus iridoplasty group ( P < .001 ) . 
There was no significant difference in IOP , medications , need for surgery , or visual function between groups at the 1-year visit . 
In eyes with synechial primary angle-closure or primary angle-closure glaucoma , both iridotomy alone or combined with iridoplasty provide a significant and equivalent reduction in IOP . 
There is also a possible reduction in peripheral anterior synechiae , more so in the iridoplasty group . 
To compare efficacy ( intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction ) and safety of preservative-free latanoprost ( T2345 ) to benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) -preserved latanoprost ( BPL ; Xalatan ) in ocular hypertension ( OHT ) or primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) patients . 
Prospective , international , multicentre , randomised , investigator-masked , parallel-group trial . 
After a wash-out period , POAG or OHT patients , previously managed by BPL monotherapy , randomly received T2345 or BPL ( one drop into the affected eye ( s ) ) once daily from D0 to D84 . 
Change in IOP was measured at 09:00 ( ±1 h ) from D0 to D84 in the worse eye . 
Mean IOP reduction ( D0-D84 ) was -8.6 ±2.6 mm Hg ( -36 % ) on T2345 and -9.0 ±2.4 mm Hg ( -38 % ) on BPL , confirming non-inferiority of T2345 to BPL . 
Non-inferiority of T2345 was observed from D15 . 
The most frequent ocular adverse event , drug intolerance , was reported in 1 ( 0.5 % ) patient on T2345 versus 4 ( 2.1 % ) patients on BPL . 
Moderate to severe conjunctival hyperaemia was less frequent on T2345 than on BPL at D42 ( 20.2 % vs 30.6 % ; p=0.003 ) and D84 ( 21.4 % vs 29.1 % ; p=0.02 ) . 
Upon instillation , the global subjective ocular symptom score was significantly lower on T2345 than BPL on D42 ( 0.15 vs 0.41 ; p=0.001 ) and D84 ( 0.18 vs 0.46 ; p=0.001 ) . 
Preservative-free latanoprost has the same efficacy as BPL , with improved local tolerance . 
To compare the effect on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of the silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve with and without an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide . 
Forty-nine patients with clinically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma were included in the study ; 22 were randomly assigned to the study group ( silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve implant with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide ) and 27 to the control group ( silicone Ahmed glaucoma valve ) . 
IOP was the primary outcome measure in this study . 
The secondary outcome measure was success , defined by IOP lower than 22 mm Hg and higher than 5 mm Hg , and no serious complications . 
Success rates in both the groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test . 
IOP levels were compared using mixed linear model analysis to correct for repeated measures correlation . 
Forty-three patients , 18 in the study group and 25 in the control group , completed the study ( follow-up of 12 mo ) . 
The mean IOP was significantly lower after 1 year in both the groups ( P < 0.001 ) . 
The mean IOP in the first month of follow-up was lower in the study group ( control ; 20.4±9.7 , study ; 13.6±6.5 , P < 0.01 ) . 
The success rate at 1 year was 78 % for the study group and 76 % for the control group ( P=0.82 ) . 
Complication rates were not different between the groups . 
Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in neovascular glaucoma did not affect the intermediate-term success of the silicone Ahmed valve nor reduce the incidence of complications . 
The mean IOP spike in the first month was lower in the triamcinolone group . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering effect of combined viscocanalostomy and phacoemulsification and combined trabeculectomy and phacoemulsification with mitomycin C in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma . 
Prospective randomized 1-year trial . 
Forty consecutive patients ( 40 eyes ) with primary open-angle glaucoma and cataract . 
Eyes were assigned randomly either to trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or to viscocanalostomy in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation . 
Success rate based on IOP . 
Mean baseline IOP was 24.0+/-2.0 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group and 23.7+/-2.6 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group ( P = 0.7 ) . Mean postoperative IOP was 13.7+/-2.2 mmHg at 3 months , 14.8+/-3.3 mmHg at 6 months , and 14.9+/-3.0 mmHg at 12 months in the viscocanalostomy group and 12.1+/-4.0 mmHg at 3 months , 13.8+/-4.7 mmHg at 6 months , and 14.1+/-4.4 mmHg at 12 months in the trabeculectomy group . 
There was no significant difference in the mean IOP between the groups at any time . 
At 12 months , 17 patients ( 85 % ) in the viscocanalostomy group and 16 patients ( 80 % ) in the trabeculectomy group achieved an IOP of 20 mmHg or less without medication ( P = 0.7 ) . 
Complications included 2 cases ( 10 % ) of flat/shallow anterior chamber and 4 cases ( 20 % ) of hypotony in the trabeculectomy group , whereas intraoperative microperforation of Descemet 's membrane occurred in 3 cases ( 15 % ) in the viscocanalostomy group . 
There was no significant difference in IOP reduction between viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C in combination with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma . 
To compare intraocular pressure ( IOP ) over time after standard trabeculectomy vs Ex-PRESS implantation in patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . 
Prospective , randomised study . 
This study included adult patients with bilateral POAG necessitating surgery . 
Each patient underwent trabeculectomy in one eye and Ex-PRESS implantation under a scleral flap in the other eye according to randomised contralateral allocations . 
Efficacy was assessed by IOP values and success rates ( IOP threshold and/or need for topical glaucoma medication ) during 30 months . 
Statistical analysis included Generalised Estimate Equation and Cox Survival models , and paired t-tests . 
Thirty eyes of 15 patients were studied for a mean of 23.6 months ( SD , ± 6.9 ) . 
At the last follow-up visit , mean pre-operative IOP decreased from 31.1 ( ± 14.2 ) to 16.2 ( ± 1.5 ) mm Hg after trabeculectomy , and from 28.1 ( ± 9.0 ) to 15.7 ( ± 1.8 ) mm Hg after Ex-PRESS implantation ( P=0.001 ) . 
The mean number of anti-glaucoma medicines prescribed at the last follow-up decreased from 3.7 pre-operatively ( both groups ) to 0.9 after trabeculectomy vs 0.3 after Ex-PRESS implantation ( P=0.001 ) . 
Complete success rates ( 5 < IOP < 18 mm Hg without medications ) were higher with Ex-PRESS compared with trabeculectomy ( P=0.0024 ) . 
Postoperative complications were more frequent after trabeculectomy ( 33 % ) compared with Ex-PRESS ( 20 % ) , with four trabeculectomy eyes ( 27 % ) needing postoperative interventions , compared with none with Ex-PRESS . 
Trabeculectomy and Ex-PRESS implantation provided similar IOP control , but the Ex-PRESS group had a lower rate of complications , fewer postoperative interventions , and needed less glaucoma medications . 
To compare the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide combination in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) or ocular hypertension during 6 months of treatment . 
A sample of 65 patients with a diagnosis of POAG or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03 % once daily or timolol-dorzolamide combination twice daily . 
Study visits occurred at baseline and after 2 weeks and 1 , 3 and 6 months of therapy . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) measurements were performed at 12.00 hours at all study visits and also at 08.00 hours and 16.00 hours at baseline and 6-month visits . 
At each visit , local and systemic side-effects that occurred during the treatment period were recorded . 
Student 's t-test was used to compare the differences between IOP values . 
Differences in IOP between the bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide groups were statistically insignificant at all study visits ( p > 0.05 ) . 
In the bimatoprost-treated group , the IOP reduction was 6.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg , whereas it was 6.5 +/- 2.3 mmHg in the timolol-dorzolamide group after 6 months of treatment . 
The difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.48 ) . 
The IOP-lowering efficacies of bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide combination were similar over a 6-month follow-up . 
Both bimatoprost and the timolol-dorzolamide combination were well tolerated . 
Bimatoprost can be used as a longterm monotherapy agent in the treatment of POAG and ocular hypertension . 
To compare the efficacy and side effects and the effect on aqueous humor dynamics of 0.005 % latanoprost applied topically once daily with 0.5 % timolol given twice daily for 12 months to patients with pigmentary glaucoma . 
Prospective , randomized , double-masked , clinical study . 
Thirty-six patients affected with bilateral pigmentary glaucoma controlled with no more than a single hypotensive medication were enrolled in the study . 
The sample population was randomly divided into 2 age- and gender-matched groups each of 18 patients . 
Group 1 received 0.005 % latanoprost eyedrops once daily and the vehicle ( placebo ) once daily ; group 2 was assigned to timolol 0.5 % eyedrops twice daily . 
Diurnal curves of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) were performed on the baseline day and after 0.5 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months of treatment . 
The IOP measurements were performed at 8:00 AM , 12:00 noon , 4:00 PM , and 8:00 PM . 
Outflow facility ( C ) was measured on the baseline day and on the last day of the study with a Schiotz electronic tonometer . 
A two-tailed Student 's t test for paired or unpaired data was used for statistical evaluation of differences between treatment and baseline values or between the latanoprost and timolol group . 
Diurnal IOP measurements were compared hour by hour . 
Mean values of the two eyes IOP and C were used for analysis . 
Compared with baseline measurements , both latanoprost and timolol caused a significant ( P < 0.001 ) reduction of IOP at each hour of diurnal curve throughout the duration of therapy . 
Reduction of IOP was 6.0 +/- 4.5 and 5.9 +/- 4.6 with latanoprost and 4.8 +/- 3.0 and 4.6 +/- 3.1 with timolol after 6 and 12 months , respectively . 
Comparison of mean diurnal measurements with latanoprost and timolol showed a statistical significant ( P < 0.001 ) difference at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . 
Mean C was found to be significantly enhanced ( +30 % ) only in the latanoprost-treated group compared with the baseline ( P = 0.017 ) . 
Mean conjunctival hyperemia was graded at 0.3 in latanoprost-treated eyes and 0.2 in timolol-treated eyes . 
A remarkable change in iris color was observed in both eyes of 1 of the 18 patients treated with latanoprost and none of the 18 patients who received timolol . 
Darkening of the peripheral iris stroma was suspected in two patients treated with latanoprost . 
In the timolol group , heart rate was significantly reduced from 72 +/- 9 at baseline to 67 +/- 10 beats per minute at 12 months . 
Although further studies may need to confirm these data on a larger sample and to evaluate the side effect of increased iris pigmentation on long-term follow-up , in patients with pigmentary glaucoma , 0.005 % latanoprost taken once daily was well tolerated and more effective in reducing IOP than 0.5 % timolol taken twice daily . 
Increased intraocular pressure ( IOP ) has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for developing glaucoma . 
Yet it has not been clearly demonstrated that IOP-lowering treatment can reduce the incidence of glaucoma damage in patients with ocular hypertension . 
The aim of the current paper was to report the results of a long-term study addressing this very problem . 
We conducted a randomised , double-masked study comparing timolol and placebo treatment in 90 patients with ocular hypertension plus some additional risk factor . 
Patients were followed at 3-month intervals prospectively for 10 years or until glaucomatous field loss could be demonstrated with computerised perimetry . 
A post-study analysis was performed including all available data , thus extending maximum follow-up to 17 years . 
After 5 years of follow-up eight patients in the placebo group and five patients in the timolol group had developed glaucomatous field loss ( NS ) ; the corresponding figures after 10 years were 15 patients in the placebo group and seven patients in the timolol group . 
Survival analysis showed a tendency but no statistically significant difference between treatment groups ( P = 0.07 ) . 
Study attrition was large . 
Eighteen patients in each group had developed glaucomatous field loss when also post-study data were included . 
IOP reduction was greater in eyes passing the 10-year visit without field loss ( 5.7 mmHg ) , than in those that reached an end-point ( 2.3 mmHg ; P = 0.0002 ) . 
In this long-term study we found a tendency but failed to prove a beneficial effect of topical timolol treatment in patients with elevated IOP , normal visual fields and some additional risk factor . 
The intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference between treatment groups . 
The high attrition shows the difficulties associated with very long follow-up . 
Trabeculectomy is a commonly used surgical treatment for glaucoma . 
To evaluate the effectiveness of combination of permanent and releasable scleral flap sutures to minimize the immediate postoperative complications of trabeculectomy . 
This study was carried out in Department of Ophthalmology , B P Koirala Institute of Health Sciences , Dharan , Nepal . 
Forty one eyes of 34 patients undergoing trabeculectomy were randomized to undergo either conventional trabeculectomy ( Group A= 20 eyes ) or trabeculectomy with combination of permanent and releasable scleral flap sutures ( Group B =21 eyes ) . 
The parameters studied were intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) and surgical complications over a period of 6 weeks . 
Significantly higher number of eyes belonging to group A ( 14 eyes ) had shallower anterior chamber than group B ( 7 eyes ) on first post operative day ( p=0.042 ) . 
Six eyes ( 30 % ) in group A had peripheral or central irido-corneal touch in early postoperative period as compared to only one in Group B. Hypotony was noted in 3 eyes in each group . 
Two patients in group A required reformation of anterior chamber . 
Other surgical complications in the two groups were similar . 
Both the groups had a significant drop in IOP following surgery . 
However , there was no significant difference in the IOP between the two groups after 6 weeks ( Group A : 10.95 +/- 3.03 mmHg vs. Group B : 12.29 +/- 4.67 mmHg ; p=0.87 ) . 
There was a significant drop in IOP following removal of sutures ( 15.19 +/- 6.15 mmHg to 13.19 +/- 6.13 mmHg ; p=006 ) in group B . 
Use of combination of permanent and releasable scleral flap sutures is a safe technique that significantly reduces the incidence of immediate postoperative shallow anterior chamber after trabeculectomy . 
To compare the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) and travoprost on 24-hour IOP fluctuations in primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and normal-tension glaucoma ( NTG ) . 
Sixty eyes were included . 
Sixteen and 14 eyes of POAG patients were randomized to receive 360° SLT or 0.004 % travoprost , respectively . 
Fourteen and 16 eyes of NTG patients were randomized to receive either SLT or travoprost , respectively . 
The 24-hour IOP data were collected before treatment and 6 to 8 weeks after treatment . 
IOP was measured at 2 hours intervals in the sitting position during daytime ( 9 AM to 7 PM ) and in the supine position during nighttime ( 9 PM to 7 AM ) . 
Main outcome measure was the percentage of eyes that achieved posttreatment 24-hour IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg . 
Success in fluctuation reduction was defined as at least a 50 % reduction in these fluctuations . 
Fifty-eight eyes were analyzed . 
Overall , eyes in the SLT and the travoprost groups achieved a significant reduction in IOP compared with the baseline IOP values ( -3.7 mm Hg [ P = 0.002 ] vs -4.1 mm Hg [ P < 0.001 ] , respectively ) . 
There was no significant difference in IOP reduction in both groups according to type of glaucoma . 
During the diurnal period , 100 % of POAG eyes in the travoprost group achieved posttreatment IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg , and 87 % of eyes in the SLT group achieved the same level of fluctuations ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Ninety-six percent of NTG eyes in the travoprost group , and 82 % of eyes in the SLT group had IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg ( P = 0.01 ) . 
Success in fluctuation reduction was 75 % and 92 % for the SLT and travoprost groups , respectively ( P = 0.005 ) . 
The effect of travoprost on IOP reduction in POAG and NTG patients was significant both during the daytime and the nighttime , while the SLT 's effect was significant only during the nighttime . 
Both travoprost and SLT can significantly reduce the IOP in patients with POAG and NTG . 
Based on habitual positions , travoprost better controls IOP fluctuations than SLT , especially during the daytime . 
To compare selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) and argon laser trabeculoplasty ( ALT ) , in terms of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) lowering , in patients with open-angle glaucoma . 
176 eyes of 152 patients were enrolled in this study , 89 in the SLT and 87 in the ALT groups . 
Patients were randomised to receive either SLT or ALT treatment to 180 degrees of the trabecular meshwork . 
Patients were followed up to 12 months after treatment . 
The main outcome measured was IOP lowering at 12 months after treatment , compared between the SLT and ALT groups . 
No significant difference ( p = 0.846 ) was found in mean decrease in IOP between the SLT ( 5.86 mm Hg ) and ALT ( 6.04 mm Hg ) groups at 1 year or at any other time points , nor were there any significant differences in the rate of early or late complications between the two groups . 
SLT is equivalent to ALT in terms of IOP lowering at 1 year , and is a safe and effective procedure for patients with open-angle glaucoma . 
Many physicians recommend either brimonidine or latanoprost as firstline therapy for chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
However , a search of MEDLINE indicates that there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the 2 monotherapies in a clinical setting . 
This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine 0.2 % twice daily with those of latanoprost 0.005 % once daily as monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
In this 3-month , multicenter , double-masked , parallel-group , 4-visit study , treatment-naive and previously treated patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and bilateral intraocular pressure ( IOP ) after washout of between 22 and 34 mm Hg were randomized to receive either brimonidine or latanoprost . 
Patients who had received previous treatment with either study drug were excluded from the study . 
The primary outcome measure was response rate , defined as the percentage of patients achieving > or = 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline to month 3 . 
Secondary outcome measures were mean IOP reduction from baseline to month 3 and clinical success , defined as the investigator 's recommendation that the patient continue using the assigned study medication . 
A total of 127 patients ( 55 treatment naive ) were enrolled , 66 in the brimonidine group and 61 in the latanoprost group . 
After 3 months of treatment , 80 % of patients in the brimonidine group and 74 % of patients in the latanoprost group had achieved > or = 20 % reduction in IOP from baseline . 
The mean reduction in IOP from baseline at month 3 was 6.8 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.5 mm Hg with latanoprost ( 27.8 % vs 27.0 % , respectively ) . 
Among treatment-naive patients , a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine-treated patients achieved > or = 20 % decrease in IOP compared with latanoprost-treated patients ( 88 % vs 59 % , respectively ; P = 0.01 ) . 
In previously treated patients , a higher percentage of the latanoprost group achieved > or = 20 % reduction in IOP compared with the brimonidine group ( 88 % vs 74 % , respectively ) ; however , the difference was not statistically significant . 
Significantly more patients in the brimonidine group achieved clinical success at month 3 compared with patients in the latanoprost group ( 91 % vs 74 % ; P = 0.01 ) . 
At peak effect , brimonidine twice daily was as effective as latanoprost once daily in lowering IOP . 
In treatment-naive patients , latanoprost was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonresponse after 3 months of treatment compared with brimonidine . 
This suggests that brimonidine may be the more reliable choice for first-line therapy of newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
In previously treated patients , however , latanoprost provided greater mean IOP reduction than did brimonidine . 
Significantly more patients achieved clinical success with brimonidine monotherapy than with latanoprost monotherapy . 
To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of a single trabecular micro-bypass stent with concomitant cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone for mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma . 
Twenty-nine investigational sites , United States . 
Prospective randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial . 
Eyes with mild to moderate glaucoma with an unmedicated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of 22 mm Hg or higher and 36 mm Hg or lower were randomly assigned to have cataract surgery with iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent implantation ( stent group ) or cataract surgery alone ( control group ) . 
Patients were followed for 24 months postoperatively . 
The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups through 24 months of follow-up . 
At 24 months , the proportion of patients with an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower without ocular hypotensive medications was significantly higher in the stent group than in the control group ( P=.036 ) . 
Overall , the mean IOP was stable between 12 months and 24 months ( 17.0 mm Hg ± 2.8 [ SD ] and 17.1 ± 2.9 mm Hg , respectively ) in the stent group but increased ( 17.0 ± 3.1 mm Hg to 17.8 ± 3.3 mm Hg , respectively ) in the control group . 
Ocular hypotensive medication was statistically significantly lower in the stent group at 12 months ; it was also lower at 24 months , although the difference was no longer statistically significant . 
Patients with combined single trabecular micro-bypass stent and cataract surgery had significantly better IOP control on no medication through 24 months than patients having cataract surgery alone . 
Both groups had a similar favorable long-term safety profile . 
To determine if postoperative topical cyclosporine 0.05 % has any beneficial effect following trabeculectomy . 
This was an interventional , randomized , prospective , double-masked clinical trial of 44 consecutive patients with uncontrolled glaucoma requiring filtration surgery . 
Ocular surface disease index questionnaire and comprehensive ocular exam , including Schirmer 's tear test 1 , were performed . 
Patients underwent routine trabeculectomy , with or without phacoemulsification . 
The study group ( n = 22 ) received cyclosporine 0.05 % , and the control group ( n = 22 ) received artificial tears . 
Patients were evaluated at 1 and 6 months post surgery . 
Outcome measures were intraocular pressure , success rate , bleb appearance , ocular surface disease index , Schirmer 's tear test 1 and conjunctival inflammation . 
Thirty-nine patients completed the study ( 19 in the study group , 20 in the control group ) . 
The mean baseline intraocular pressure was 23.8 +/- 12.6 mmHg in the study group and 25.9 +/- 10.6 mmHg in the control group ( P = 0.513 ) . 
Mean intraocular pressure at postoperative month 6 was 14.88 +/- 6.2 and 14.62 +/- 5.46 mmHg in the study group and control group , respectively ( P = 0.837 ) . 
There was no statistically significant difference in the mean values of Schirmer 's tear test 1 and the level of conjunctival hyperaemia between the two groups at baseline , months 1 and 6 post surgery . 
The treatment group had a statistically significant decrease in ocular surface disease index score at 6 months ( P = 0.003 ) , indicating less severity of dry eye symptoms and significant reduction in ocular pain . 
Topical cyclosporine 0.05 % had no effect on postoperative bleb function and intraocular pressure following trabeculectomy , but improved subjective ocular surface symptoms in these patients . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of 0.0015 % tafluprost ophthalmic solution ( Tafluprost ) with Placebo ophthalmic solution ( Placebo ) in normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) . 
Total of 94 patients enrolled in a randomized , double-blind , parallel-group and multicenter study . 
Patients with NTG were randomly assigned to either Tafluprost or Placebo . 
Both ophthalmic solutions were instilled once a day in the morning for 4 weeks . 
Mean intraocular pressure ( IOP ) changes from baseline were -4.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg in Tafluprost administered patients and -1.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg in Placebo administered patients at 4 weeks , with a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.001 ) . 
IOP change at 4 weeks , % IOP reduction at 2 and 4 weeks were also significantly greater in Tafluprost than in Placebo . 
A total of 51.0 % in Tafluprost treated group and 8.9 % in Placebo treated group reported adverse drug reactions . 
These results indicate that Tafluprost is clinically useful in the treatment of NTG . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering effect and safety of topical brimonidine to that of timolol , and to study the additive effect of topical brimonidine to topical prostaglandin ( PG ) analogues in 475 patients with either ocular hypertension or primary open angle glaucoma . 
The primary endpoint was the mean IOP change from the baseline at 0 and 2 hours at week 4 . 
The mean changes were -4.7 +/- 2.1 ( S. D. ) in the timolol and -4.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg in the brimonidine group ( p = 0.0138 ) . 
The 95 % confidence interval of the inter-group difference was greater than the pre-determined criterion of non-inferiority of brimonidine to timolol . 
When added to PG analogues , the IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine ( -2.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg ) was greater than that of the placebo ( -2.1 +/- 1.8 mmHg ) ( p = 0.0010 ) . 
No appreciable adverse side effects were encountered . 
Topical brimonidine showed an additive IOP-lowering effect to topical PG analogues , although its IOP-lowering effect was inferior to topical timolol as monotherapy . 
To evaluate the intraocular pressure-lowering efficacy and safety of travoprost 0.0015 % and 0.004 % , dosed daily in the evening compared with vehicle , in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension , whose intraocular pressure was not adequately controlled on timolol 0.5 % twice daily ( twice daily ) . 
Subjects who qualified at screening began a run-in period dosing timolol twice daily for 3 weeks . 
If the subjects had an intraocular pressure of 24 to 36 mm Hg at 8 AM and 21 to 36 mm Hg at 10 AM and 4 pm in at least one eye on timolol , they were randomized to one of two concentrations of travoprost ( 0.0015 % or 0.004 % ) or vehicle solution every day and were followed for 6 months . 
Four hundred twenty-six subjects were randomized . 
The mean intraocular pressure at 8 AM , 10 AM , and 4 PM in the patient 's eye with the higher intraocular pressure was used for the analysis . 
Mean baseline values ( 25 mm Hg ) for subjects at eligibility ( while maintained on timolol ) were not significantly different ( P < .0001 ) among the treatment groups . 
The intraocular pressure was lowered an additional -5.7 to -7.2 mm Hg and -5.1 to -6.7 mm Hg in the travoprost 0.004 % and 0.0015 % concentrations , respectively . 
These changes were significantly ( P < or =.0001 ) different from the vehicle group ( -1.3 to -2.8 mm Hg ) . 
The intraocular pressure range on treatment at all visit times over the 6-month treatment period ranged from 17.9 to 19.2 mm Hg for travoprost 0.004 % and 18.3 to 20.1 mm Hg for travoprost 0.0015 % compared with 22.4 to 24.1 mm Hg for vehicle . 
Average hyperemia scores ranged from trace to mild ( mean 0.5 on a scale of 0 = none/trace ; 1= mild ; 2 = moderate ; 3 = severe ) for all treatment groups . 
No iris pigmentation changes were observed in any patient during this study . 
There were no clinically or statistically significant changes from baseline in visual acuity , ocular cells and flare , fundus parameter , cup-to-disk ratio and visual field between the treatment groups . 
There were no serious adverse events reported for any treatment group . 
Travoprost produced clinically relevant and statistically significant additional intraocular pressure reductions from baseline when used adjunctively with timolol in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
To compare the short- and intermediate-term results of two commonly used glaucoma surgical procedures , trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant . 
A randomized clinical trial was performed at two international centers . 
One eye each of consecutive patients requiring glaucoma surgery for intraocular pressure control was randomized to receive either trabeculectomy or the Ahmed implant . 
Of the 117 patients , 62 were randomized to trabeculectomy and 55 to the Ahmed implant . 
With a mean follow-up of 9.7 months , the trabeculectomy group had statistically lower intraocular pressures at weeks 6 to 15 ( 12.6 mm Hg vs 16.4 mm Hg ) and months 11 to 13 ( 11.4 mm Hg vs 17.2 mm Hg ) than the Ahmed implant group . 
Compared with preoperative status , no statistically significant differences between groups were noted for visual acuity , visual field , lens status , and final anterior chamber depth . 
The cumulative probabilities of success ( intraocular pressure < 21 mm Hg and at least 15 % reduction in intraocular pressure from preoperative level ) were 83.6 % for trabeculectomy and 88.1 % for Ahmed implant ( P =.43 ) . 
However , the Ahmed implant group had a greater adjunctive medication requirement . 
On the last visit , 10 of the trabeculectomy eyes and 19 of the Ahmed implant eyes required at least one topical medication ( P =.01 ) . 
There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups . 
Lower mean intraocular pressures were noted for the trabeculectomy group . 
All other results , including success ( as defined in this study ) and frequency of complications , were comparable between the two groups . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reducing effect and safety of latanoprost 0.005 % once daily with unoprostone 0.12 % twice daily in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) or ocular hypertension ( OH ) . 
An 8-week , double-masked , randomized , parallel-group , single-center clinical trial . 
A total of 108 patients with POAG or OH were enrolled . 
After completing a wash-out of ocular hypotensive medications , patients were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening plus placebo once daily in the morning , or unoprostone twice daily ( morning and evening ) . 
IOP was measured at 10:00 AM and at 5:00 PM at baseline and at week 8 , and before 12:00 noon at week 2 . 
Ocular and systemic safety assessments were performed . 
From an overall baseline of 24.1 mmHg , latanoprost reduced IOP by 6.7 mmHg ( 28 % ) and unoprostone reduced IOP by 3.3 mmHg ( 14 % ) . 
The difference between the groups of 3.4 mmHg was significant ( P : < 0.001 , analysis of covariance ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : -4.7 to -2.1 ) in favor of latanoprost . 
A > /=30 % reduction in mean IOP from baseline was achieved by 44 % of latanoprost-treated patients compared with 8 % of unoprostone-treated patients . 
The incidence of adverse events was low and comparable between the groups . 
Latanoprost administered once daily was significantly more effective in reducing IOP compared with unoprostone administered twice daily in patients with POAG and OH . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of latanoprost versus timolol in pediatric patients with glaucoma . 
Prospective , randomized , double-masked , 12-week , multicenter study . 
Individuals aged < 18 years with glaucoma . 
Stratified by age , diagnosis , and intraocular pressure ( IOP ) level , subjects were randomized ( 1:1 ) to latanoprost vehicle at 8 am and latanoprost 0.005 % at 8 pm or timolol 0.5 % ( 0.25 % for those aged < 3 years ) twice daily ( 8 am , 8 pm ) . 
At baseline and weeks 1 , 4 , and 12 , IOP and ocular safety were assessed and adverse events were recorded . 
Therapy was switched to open-label latanoprost pm and timolol am and pm for uncontrolled IOP . 
Mean IOP reduction from baseline to week 12 . 
Latanoprost was considered noninferior to timolol if the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of the difference was > -3 mmHg . 
A proportion of responders ( subjects with 15 % IOP reduction at weeks 4 and 12 ) were evaluated . 
Analyses were performed in diagnosis subgroups : primary congenital glaucoma ( PCG ) and non-PCG . 
In total , 137 subjects were treated ( safety population ; 12-18 years , n=48 ; 3- < 12 years , n=55 ; 0- < 3 years , n=34 ) . 
Mean age was 8.8±5.5 years , and mean baseline IOP was 27.7±6.17 mmHg ; 125 subjects completed the study , and 107 subjects were in the per protocol population . 
Mean IOP reductions for latanoprost and timolol at week 12 were 7.2 and 5.7 mmHg , respectively , with a difference of 1.5 mmHg ( 95 % CI , -0.8 to 3.7 ; P=0.21 ) . 
Responder rates were 60 % for latanoprost and 52 % for timolol ( P=0.33 ) . 
Between-treatment differences in mean IOP reduction for PCG and non-PCG subgroups were 0.6 mmHg ( 95 % CI , -2.3 to 3.4 ) and 2.6 mmHg ( 95 % CI , -0.8 to 6.1 ) , respectively . 
Responder rates for latanoprost versus timolol were 50 % versus 46 % for the PCG group and 72 % versus 57 % for the non-PCG group . 
Both therapies were well tolerated . 
Latanoprost 0.005 % is not inferior ( i.e. , is either more or similarly effective ) to timolol and produces clinically relevant IOP reductions across pediatric patients with and without PCG . 
Both latanoprost and timolol had favorable safety profiles over the duration of this 3-month trial . 
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering efficacy of travoprost/timolol in a benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) -free fixed combination preserved with polyquaternium-1 ( TRA/TIM BAK-free ) , with travoprost/timolol-fixed combination preserved with BAK ( TRA/TIM ) , in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
In this prospective randomized controlled trial , subjects with IOP of at least 22 mm Hg in one or both eyes at 0900 h , and IOP of at least 21 mm Hg in one or both eyes at 1100 h and 1600 h at two eligibility visits were randomly assigned to receive either TRA/TIM BAK-free ( n=195 ) or TRA/TIM ( n=193 ) , dosed once daily in the morning ( 0900 h ) for 6 weeks . 
IOP was assessed at 0900 h , 1100 h , and 1600 h at each scheduled visit ( baseline , 2 and 6 weeks after randomization ) . 
Mean IOP reduction across all visits and time points was 8.0 mm Hg in the TRA/TIM BAK-free group and 8.4 mm Hg in the TRA/TIM group ( P=0.0943 ) . 
The difference in mean IOP between groups ranged from 0.2 to 0.7 mm Hg across visits and time points , with a mean pooled difference of 0.4 mm Hg ( 95 % CI : -0.1 to 0.8 ) , demonstrating equivalence of the two formulations . 
The most common drug-related adverse event was hyperemia of the eye ( ocular hyperemia and conjunctival hyperemia combined ) , occurring in 11.8 % of the TRA/TIM BAK-free group and 13.0 % of the TRA/TIM group . 
Travoprost/timolol BAK-free demonstrated equivalence to travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK in efficacy . 
No clinically relevant differences in the safety profiles of travoprost/timolol BAK-free and travoprost/timolol preserved with BAK were identified . 
To compare the effect of treatment with latanoprost or brimonidine on intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and intraocular pressure inadequately controlled by monotherapy or dual therapy . 
Three hundred seventy-nine patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited for this 6-month prospective , randomized , observer-masked multicenter study involving 30 eye clinics . 
All patients were receiving monotherapy or dual therapy that did not adequately control intraocular pressure . 
After appropriate washout periods , patients were randomized to treatment with latanoprost once daily or brimonidine twice daily . 
The main outcome measure was change in mean diurnal intraocular pressure after 6 months of treatment compared with baseline . 
Of the 379 randomized patients , 375 were included in the intent-to-treat analysis . 
From an overall baseline mean intraocular pressure of 25.0 mm Hg , latanoprost monotherapy reduced mean diurnal intraocular pressure by 7.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg ( mean +/- SD , P < 0.001 ) , whereas brimonidine monotherapy yielded an intraocular-pressure reduction of 5.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) . 
This 1.9 mm Hg difference in intraocular-pressure reduction was significantly in favor of latanoprost ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Ocular allergy ( P < 0.001 ) and systemic side effects ( P = 0.005 ) were reported significantly less frequently by latanoprost-treated patients compared with brimonidine-treated patients . 
Both latanoprost and brimonidine reduced intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension after 6 months of treatment . 
However , latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective than brimonidine twice daily in reducing mean diurnal intraocular pressure . 
Latanoprost was better tolerated with less frequently occurring ocular allergy and systemic side effects . 
To assess the intraocular pressure-lowering efficacy and the postoperative complication profile of viscocanalostomy versus trabeculectomy . 
Sixty eyes of 60 patients with medically uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma were randomized either to the viscocanalostomy or to the trabeculectomy group of the trial . 
Viscocanalostomy was performed according to Stegmann 's technique using high-molecular-weight sodium hyaluronate to fill the ostia of the Schlemm canal . 
For trabeculectomy , a modified Cairns-trabeculectomy was performed . 
Examinations were performed before surgery and postoperatively daily for 1 week . 
Follow-up visits were scheduled 1 , 6 , and 12 months after surgery . 
The mean ( SD ) preoperative intraocular pressure was 27.1 ( 7.1 ) mm Hg for all patients enrolled . 
One day after surgery , mean ( SD ) intraocular pressure was 15.9 ( 5.2 ) for the trabeculectomy group ( P < 0.001 ) and 15.7 ( 3.6 ) for the viscocanalostomy group ( P < 0.001 ) , respectively . 
The success rate , defined as an intraocular pressure lower than 22 mm Hg without medication , was 56.7 % in the trabeculectomy group and 30 % in the viscocanalostomy group at 12 months postoperatively ( P = 0.041 ) . 
The number of postoperative complications was lower in the viscocanalostomy group than in the trabeculectomy group . 
In eyes with open-angle glaucoma , viscocanalostomy is less effective in reducing intraocular pressure than standard filtering surgery . 
However , postoperative complications are more frequent after filtering surgery . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering effect and safety of latanoprost 0.005 % once daily with that of unoprostone 0.15 % twice daily for patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Randomized clinical trial . 
In a prospective , 8-week , investigator-masked , parallel-group study conducted at numerous centers in the United States , 165 previously treated patients with IOP > or= 25 mm Hg in one or both eyes after washout were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprost 0.005 % once daily in the evening or unoprostone 0.15 % twice daily . 
Observations procedures were Goldmann applanation tonometry , best-corrected visual acuity , slit lamp biomicroscopy , and ophthalmoscopy . 
The main outcome measure was change in the mean of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM , 12 noon , and 4:00 PM between baseline ( before treatment ) and after 8 weeks of treatment . 
The change in the mean +/- SD of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM , 12 noon , and 4:00 PM was -7.2 +/- 3.2 mm Hg ( 28 % ) for latanoprost ( 25.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at baseline to 18.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at 8 weeks ) and -3.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg ( 15 % ) for unoprostone ( 25.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg at baseline to 21.6 +/- 4.0 mm Hg ; P < or=.001 . 
No serious adverse event related to either medication was reported . 
Over an 8-week period , latanoprost 0.005 % once daily lowered IOP more than unoprostone 0.15 % twice daily in patients with elevated IOP . 
Both agents were safe and well tolerated . 
To compare viscocanalostomy , a nonpenetrating procedure for glaucoma treatment , with trabeculectomy . 
Randomized controlled trial . 
Twenty white subjects ( 20 eyes ) with open-angle glaucoma with no history of surgery were enrolled . 
Ten subjects were randomly assigned to viscocanalostomy according to Stegmann 's technique and 10 subjects to a modified Cairns trabeculectomy . 
A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed the day before surgery and postoperatively . 
Further visits were scheduled monthly for 6 to 8 months after surgery . 
Success was defined as intraocular pressure ( IOP ) between 7 and 20 mmHg , with no medication . 
After a mean follow-up of 6 months ( range , 6-8 months ) , success was obtained in 5 of 10 cases in the trabeculectomy group and in 0 of 10 case in the viscocanalostomy group . 
With Kaplan-Meier 's method , subjects with viscocanalostomy showed shorter postoperative IOP-reduction periods than subjects undergoing trabeculectomy . 
According to the results of this short-term study , trabeculectomy was more effective than viscocanalostomy in lowering IOP in glaucomatous eyes of white patients . 
To compare outcomes of selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) with drug therapy for glaucoma patients in a prospective randomized clinical trial . 
Sixty-nine patients ( 127 eyes ) with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to SLT or medical therapy . 
Target intraocular pressure ( IOP ) was determined using the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study formula . 
Patients were treated with SLT ( 100 applications 360 degrees ) or medical therapy ( prostaglandin analog ) . 
Six visits over 1 year followed initial treatment . 
If target IOP range was not attained with SLT , additional SLT was the next step , or in the medical arm additional medications were added . 
Primary outcome : IOP ; secondary : number of steps . 
Sixty-nine patients were treated . 
Data collection terminated with 54 patients reaching 9 to 12-months follow-up . 
Twenty-nine patients were in the SLT group , 25 patients in the medical group . 
Baseline mean IOP for all eyes was 24.5 mm Hg in the SLT group , 24.7 mm Hg in the medical group . Mean IOP ( both eyes ) at last follow-up was 18.2 mm Hg ( 6.3 mm Hg reduction ) in the SLT arm , 17.7 mm Hg ( 7.0 mm Hg reduction ) in the medical arm . 
By last follow-up , 11 % of eyes received additional SLT , 27 % required additional medication . 
There was not a statistically significant difference between the SLT and medication groups . 
IOP reduction was similar in both arms after 9 to 12-months follow-up . 
More treatment steps were necessary to maintain target IOP in the medication group , although there was not a statistically significant difference between groups . 
These results support the option of SLT as a safe and effective initial therapy in open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
To compare the efficacy and safety of viscocanalostomy and trabeculectomy in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . 
Department of Ophthalmology , Ankara Education and Research Hospital , Ankara , Turkey . 
In this prospective randomized trial , 50 eyes of 50 patients with medically uncontrolled POAG were randomized to have a trabeculectomy ( 25 eyes ) or a viscocanalostomy ( 25 eyes ) . 
Visual acuity , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , and slitlamp examinations were performed before surgery and 1 day , 1 week , 1 , 3 , and 6 months , and 1 , 2 , and 3 years postoperatively . 
At 3 years , the mean IOP was 16.0 mmHg +/- 7.07 ( SD ) in the trabeculectomy group and 17.8 +/- 4.6 mmHg in the viscocanalostomy group ( P=.694 ) . 
Complete success ( IOP 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication ) was achieved in 66.2 % of eyes at 6 months and 55.1 % at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 52.9 % and 35.3 % , respectively , in the viscocanalostomy group ( P > .05 ) . 
Qualified success ( IOP 6 to 21 mmHg with medication ) was achieved in 95.8 % of eyes at 6 months and 79.2 % at 3 years in the trabeculectomy group and in 90.7 % and 73.9 % , respectively , in the viscocanalostomy group ( P > .05 ) . 
Postoperative hypotony and cataract formation occurred more frequently in the trabeculectomy group than in the viscocanalostomy group ( P=.002 ) . 
Primary trabeculectomy lowered IOP more than viscocanalostomy in POAG patients . 
However , the complication rate was lower in the viscocanalostomy group . 
To investigate risk factors associated with visual field progression in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study , a prospective trial designed to compare the effects of the alpha2-adrenergic agonist brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % to the beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol maleate 0.5 % on visual function in low-pressure glaucoma . 
Prospective cohort study . 
Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with ≥5 visual field tests during follow-up were included . 
Progression was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis , defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB/year at P < 5 % , on 3 consecutive tests . 
Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model . 
A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects ( mean age , 64.7 10.9 years ; mean follow-up , 40.6 12 months ) were analyzed . 
Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine ( mean rates of progression , -0.38 0.9 vs 0.02 0.7 dB/y , P < .01 ) . 
In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates , older age ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.41/decade older , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.05 to 1.90 , P = .022 ) , use of systemic antihypertensives ( HR = 2.53 , 95 % CI = 1.32 to 4.87 , P = .005 ) , and mean ocular perfusion pressure ( HR = 1.21/mm Hg lower , 95 % CI = 1.12 to 1.31 , P < .001 ) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect ( HR = 0.26 , 95 % CI = 0.12 to 0.55 , P < .001 ) . 
While randomization to brimonidine 0.2 % was protective compared to timolol 0.5 % , lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study . 
This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms . 
The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2 % arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms . 
To compare the effect of time on therapy , efficacy , tolerability and resource utilization of latanoprost or non-prostaglandin analogues ( non-PGs ) in patients who required a change in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering monotherapy . 
This open-label , multicentre study ( Sweden , 19 sites ; Finland , seven sites ) included adults with glaucoma or ocular hypertension with mean diurnal IOP > or = 21 mmHg on ocular hypotensive monotherapy . 
Patients were randomized to latanoprost monotherapy or non-PG therapy ( commercially available therapy other than a PG ) and followed for 36 months . 
End-points included : time to treatment failure ( baseline to visit with a change in/addition to treatment ) ; diurnal IOP ( mean of 08.00 , 12.00 and 16:00 hr measurements ) at months 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 ; tolerability ; and resource utilization , where analyses used Swedish and Finnish 2006 unit costs . 
Three hundred and twenty-six patients received > or = 1 dose of latanoprost ( n = 162 ) or non-PGs ( n = 164 ) . 
Median time to treatment failure was longer for latanoprost ( 36 months ) than for non-PGs ( 12 months ; p < 0.001 ) ; 51 % and 24 % of patients remained on randomized therapy after 36 months , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . 
Decreases in mean diurnal IOP from baseline were significantly greater for latanoprost than for non-PGs at months 6 and 12 ( p < 0.01 ) . 
No serious adverse events were judged to be treatment-related . 
Mean total 36-month direct costs were similar in patients initiated with latanoprost and non-PGs . 
Patients who failed previous monotherapy remained on therapy longer when switched to latanoprost . 
The IOP-reducing effect of latanoprost and tolerability were sustained over the long term . 
Resource utilization and costs were generally similar in those initiating latanoprost or non-PG therapy .
