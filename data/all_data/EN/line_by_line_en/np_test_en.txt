We previously reported that treatment of patients with symptomatic advanced non-small cell lung cancer with single agent Gemcitabine ( GEM ) resulted in a superior clinical-benefit response rate ( RR ) compared to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy . 
We now report the detailed individual symptom control analysis , and the influence of cisplatin-use , age , performance status ( PS ) and duration of treatment . 
Patients received either GEM ( 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) , days 1 , 8 and 15 ) or cisplatin ( 100 mg/m ( 2 ) , day 1 ) plus Vindesine ( 3 mg/m ( 2 ) , days 1 and 15 ) ( PV ) , both every 4 weeks . 
Scores of 9 symptoms were listed weekly by the patient on visual analogue scales . 
Improvement of a symptom was defined as 2 consecutive cycles of improvement over baseline . 
Baseline symptoms in the 169 patients were well balanced between the 2 arms ( 84 GEM , 85 PV ) . 
Both patients with objective response and disease stabilisation had clearly better symptom control than those with disease progression . 
Symptom control in both arms was similar for 'disease-specific ' symptoms such as cough , dyspnea , pain or haemoptysis . 
Compared to PV , a significantly larger number of GEM-patients had better scores for 'constitutional ' items such as anorexia ( P=0.007 ) , ability to carry on with daily activities ( P=0.04 ) and overall impression of quality-of-life ( P=0.008 ) . 
Symptom control was very similar in younger ( < 65 years ) versus older ( > /=65 years ) patients , and only slightly better in those with a Karnofsky PS > /=80 % compared to those < 80 % . 
Most of the symptom improvement occurred in the first 3 cycles , with some further symptom improvement in the following cycles in the GEM-arm only . 
Both GEM and PV yield a symptom control rate much higher than expected by the objective tumour RR . 
GEM is equally effective in controlling 'disease-specific ' symptoms , but superior in controlling 'constitutional ' symptoms . 
Most of the symptom control was achieved during the first 3 cycles of treatment , with some further improvement thereafter in the GEM-arm only . 
The objective of this study was to compare the quality of life ( QoL ) of ovarian cancer patients treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin ( TC ) versus paclitaxel/cisplatin ( PT ) and to determine the impact of treatment toxicity on the various QoL domains . 
In this phase III trial , 798 patients with ovarian cancer stages IIB-IV were randomly assigned to receive TC or PT . 
The primary end point was progression-free survival ; secondary end points included toxicity , QoL , and response to treatment . 
Patients completed the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 before treatment , within 3 days before the second and the fourth chemotherapy cycle , and 3 weeks after completion of chemotherapy . 
Previously reported data showed that patients undergoing TC or PT did not differ in progression-free survival and overall survival . 
However , the TC arm was superior , indicating a better overall QoL compared with the PT arm . 
Controlling for toxicity and age , a significant treatment by assessment time interaction was found for four QoL functioning scales and three symptoms scales . 
Patients in the TC arm showed better means scores after treatment on overall QoL ( P = .012 ) , physical functioning ( P = .012 ) , role functioning ( P = .005 ) , and cognitive functioning ( P = .024 ) , compared with the PT arm . 
Concerning symptom experience , patients undergoing TC showed less nausea and vomiting ( P < .001 ) , less appetite loss ( P < .001 ) , and less fatigue ( P = .033 ) after completion of treatment compared with patients undergoing PT . 
The TC regimen achieved better QoL outcomes compared with the PT regimen . 
Thus , clinicians may consider replacing cisplatin with carboplatin when treating ovarian cancer patients with chemotherapy . 
To compare health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel ( AT ) or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide ( AC ) as first-line chemotherapy treatment . 
Eligible patients ( n = 275 ) with anthracycline-naive measurable metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to AT ( doxorubicin 60 mg/m ( 2 ) as an intravenous bolus plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m ( 2 ) as a 3-hour infusion ) or AC ( doxorubicin 60 mg/m ( 2 ) plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m ( 2 ) ) every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles . 
Dose escalation of paclitaxel ( 200 mg/m ( 2 ) ) and cyclophosphamide ( 750 mg/m ( 2 ) ) was planned at cycle 2 to reach equivalent myelosuppression in the two groups . 
HRQOL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and the EORTC Breast Module at baseline and the start of cycles 2 , 4 , and 6 , and 3 months after the last cycle . 
Seventy-nine percent of the patients ( n = 219 ) completed a baseline measure . 
However , there were no statistically significant differences in HRQOL between the two treatment groups . 
In both groups , selected aspects of HRQOL were impaired over time , with increased fatigue , although some clinically significant improvements in emotional functioning were seen , as well as a reduction in pain over time . 
Overall , global quality of life was maintained in both treatment groups . 
This information is important when advising women patients of the expected HRQOL consequences of treatment regimens and should help clinicians and their patients make informed treatment decisions . 
Research suggests that cancer rehabilitation reduces fatigue in survivors of cancer . 
To date , it is unclear what type of rehabilitation is most beneficial . 
This randomized controlled trial compared the effect on cancer-related fatigue of physical training combined with cognitive behavioral therapy with physical training alone and with no intervention . 
In this multicenter randomized controlled trial , 147 survivors of cancer were randomly assigned to a group that received physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy ( PT+CBT group , n=76 ) or to a group that received physical training alone ( PT group , n=71 ) . 
In addition , a nonintervention control group ( WLC group ) consisting of 62 survivors of cancer who were on the waiting lists of rehabilitation centers elsewhere was included . 
The study was conducted at 4 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands . 
All patients were survivors of cancer . 
Physical training consisting of 2 hours of individual training and group sports took place twice weekly , and cognitive-behavioral therapy took place once weekly for 2 hours . 
Fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory before and immediately after intervention ( 12 weeks after enrollment ) . 
The WLC group completed questionnaires at the same time points . 
Baseline fatigue did not differ significantly among the 3 groups . 
Over time , levels of fatigue significantly decreased in all domains in all groups , except in mental fatigue in the WLC group . 
Analyses of variance of postintervention fatigue showed statistically significant group effects on general fatigue , on physical and mental fatigue , and on reduced activation but not on reduced motivation . 
Compared with the WLC group , the PT group reported significantly greater decline in 4 domains of fatigue , whereas the PT+CBT group reported significantly greater decline in physical fatigue only . 
No significant differences in decline in fatigue were found between the PT+CBT and PT groups . 
Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention . 
Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue , suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training . 
The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery . 
Postoperative radiochemotherapy ( RCT ) is recommended for advanced disease ( pT3/4 or pN+ ) . 
In recent years , encouraging results of pre-operative radiotherapy have been reported . 
This prospective randomized phase-III-trial ( CAO/ARO/AIO-94 ) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant RCT to standard postoperative RCT . 
We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of RCT and postoperative morbidity . 
Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer ( uT3/4 or uN+ , Mason CS III/IV ) were randomly assigned to pre or postoperative RCT : A total dose of 50.4 Gy ( single dose 1.8 Gy ) was applied to the tumour and the pelvic lymph nodes . 
5-FU ( 1000 mg/m2/d ) was administered concomitantly in the 1th and 5th week of radiation as 120 h-continuous infusion . 
Four additional cycles of 5-FU-chemotherapy ( 500 mg/m2/d , i.v.-bolus ) were applied . 
RCT was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy postoperatively . 
The time interval between RCT and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms . 
Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision . 
Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year survival and local and distant control . 
Secondary endpoints include the rate of curative ( R0 ) resection and sphincter saving procedures , toxicity of RCT , surgical complications and quality of life . 
As of July 2002 , 805 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions . 
Acute toxicity ( WHO ) of RCT was low , with less than 15 % of patients experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicity : The principal toxicity was diarrhea , with 12 % in the postoperative RCT-arm and 11 % in the pre-operative RCT-arm having grade 3- , and 1 % in either arm having grade 4-diarrhea . 
Erythema , nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities , with less than 3 % of patients in either arm suffering grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea . 
Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms , with 12 % ( postop . RCT ) and 12 % ( pre-op . RCT ) of patients , respectively , suffering from anastomotic leakage , 3 % ( postop . RCT ) and 3 % ( pre-op . RCT ) from postoperative bleeding , and 6 % ( postop . RCT ) and 4 % ( pre-op . RCT ) from delayed wound healing . 
The patient accrual to the trial is satisfactory . 
Neoadjuvant RCT is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity . 
Sentinel lymph node resection ( SNR ) may reduce morbidity while providing the same clinical utility as conventional axillary dissection ( AD ) . 
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project ( NSABP ) B-32 is a randomized phase III trial comparing SNR immediately followed by AD ( SNAD ) to SNR and subsequent AD if SN is positive . 
We report the definitive patient-reported outcomes ( PRO ) comparisons . 
Eligible patients had clinically node-negative , operable invasive breast cancer . 
The PRO substudy included all SN-negative participants enrolled May 2001 to February 2004 at community institutions in the United States ( n = 749 ; 78 % age > or = 50 ; 87 % clinical tumor size < or = 2.0 cm ; 84 % lumpectomy ; 87 % white ) . 
They completed questionnaires presurgery , 1 and 2 to 3 weeks postoperatively , and every 6 months through year 3 . 
Arm symptoms , arm use avoidance , activity limitations , and quality of life ( QOL ) were compared with intent-to-treat two-sample t-tests and repeated measures analyses . 
Arm symptoms were significantly more bothersome for SNAD compared with SNR patients at 6 months ( mean , 4.8 v 3.0 ; P < .001 ) and at 12 months ( 3.6 v 2.5 ; P = .006 ) . 
Longitudinally , SNAD patients were more likely to experience ipsilateral arm and breast symptoms , restricted work and social activity , and impaired QOL ( P < or = .002 all items ) . 
From 12 to 36 months , fewer than 15 % of either SNAD or SNR patients reported moderate or greater severity of any given symptom or activity limitation . 
Arm morbidity was greater with SNAD than with SNR . 
Despite considerable fears about complications from AD for breast cancer , this study demonstrates that initial problems with either surgery resolve over time . 
Postcancer fatigue is a frequently occurring problem , impairing quality of life . 
Until now , little is known about ( neuro ) physiological factors determining postcancer fatigue . 
For non-cancer patients with chronic fatigue syndrome , certain characteristics of brain morphology and metabolism have been identified in previous studies . 
We investigated whether these volumetric and metabolic traits are a reflection of fatigue in general and thus also of importance for postcancer fatigue . 
Fatigued patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition ( cognitive behavior therapy ) or the waiting list condition . 
Twenty-five patients in the intervention condition and fourteen patients in the waiting list condition were assessed twice , at baseline and six months later . 
Baseline measurements of 20 fatigued patients were compared with 20 matched non-fatigued controls . 
All participants had completed treatment of a malignant , solid tumor minimal one year earlier . 
Global brain volumes , subcortical brain volumes , metabolite tissue concentrations , and metabolite ratios were primary outcome measures . 
Volumetric and metabolic parameters were not significantly different between fatigued and non-fatigued patients . 
Change scores of volumetric and metabolic parameters from baseline to follow-up were not significantly different between patients in the therapy and the waiting list group . 
Patients in the therapy group reported a significant larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group . 
No relation was found between postcancer fatigue and the studied volumetric and metabolic markers . 
This may suggest that , although postcancer fatigue and chronic fatigue syndrome show strong resemblances as a clinical syndrome , the underlying physiology is different . 
The efficacy of a home-based physical activity ( PA ) intervention for colorectal cancer patients versus contact control was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial . 
Forty-six patients ( mean age = 57.3 years [ SD = 9.7 ] , 57 % female , mean = 2.99 years post-diagnosis [ SD = 1.64 ] ) who had completed treatment for stages 1-3 colorectal cancer were randomized to telephone counseling to support PA ( PA group , n = 20 ) or contact control ( control group , n = 26 ) . 
PA group participants received 3 months of PA counseling ( based on the transtheoretical model and the social cognitive theory ) delivered via telephone , as well as weekly PA tip sheets . 
Assessments of PA ( Seven-day Physical Activity Recall [ 7-day PAR ] and Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors [ CHAMPS ] ) , submaximal aerobic fitness ( Treadwalk test ) , motivational readiness for PA , and psychosocial outcomes were conducted at baseline , 3 , 6 , and 12 months post-baseline . 
Objective accelerometer data were collected at the same time points . 
The PA group reported significant increases in minutes of PA at 3 months ( 7-day PAR ) and caloric expenditure ( CHAMPS ) compared with the control group , but the group differences were attenuated over time . 
The PA group showed significant improvements in fitness at 3 , 6 , and 12 months versus the control group . 
Improvements in motivational readiness for PA were reported in the PA group only at 3 months . 
No significant group differences were found for fatigue , self-reported physical functioning , and quality of life at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . 
A home-based intervention improved survivors ' PA and motivational readiness at 3 months and increased submaximal aerobic fitness at 3 , 6 , and 12 months . 
Cancer treatment can profoundly impact the patient 's quality of life ( QOL ) . 
It has been well documented that there are gender differences in the symptoms associated with cancer treatment . 
This study explores the impact of gender on QOL for patients with newly diagnosed advanced cancer . 
A randomized , controlled clinical trial in patients receiving radiotherapy for advanced cancer demonstrated maintenance of QOL with a six session multidisciplinary structured intervention compared to controls . 
This current study reports the gender differences in that trial . 
Outcome measures included the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general ( FACT-G ) , linear analog self-assessment ( LASA ) , and profile of mood states ( POMS ) at baseline and weeks 4 , 27 , and 52 . 
Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare QOL scores . 
One hundred thirty-one patients ( 45 women and 86 men , mean age 58.7 ) participated in the clinical trial . 
At week 4 postintervention , women in the intervention group had statistically significant improvement in their FACT-G score , FACT-G physical well-being subscale , LASA fatigue , POMS total score , POMS fatigue-inertia subscale , and POMS confusion-bewilderment subscale ( p < 0.05 ) . 
Men receiving the intervention had a smaller decrease in FACT-G score compared to controls ( p = 0.048 ) and also worsened on the LASA financial ( p = 0.02 ) . 
At week 27 , the only gender difference was that intervention group men had more POMS anger-hostility ( p = 0.009 ) . 
By week 52 , there were no statistically significant gender differences in any of the QOL measures . 
Gender-based differences appear to play a role in the early , but not late , response to a multidisciplinary intervention to improve QOL for patients with advanced cancer , suggesting that early interventions can be tailored for each gender . 
Surgical resection enhances long-term survival after lung cancer , but survivors face functional deficits and report on poor quality of life long time after surgery . 
This study evaluated short and long-term effects of supervised group exercise training on health-related quality of life and physical performance in patients , who were radically operated for lung cancer . 
A randomized , assessor-blinded , controlled trial was performed on 78 patients undergoing lung cancer surgery . 
The intervention group ( IG , n=41 ) participated in supervised out-patient exercise training sessions , one hour once a week for ten weeks . 
The sessions were based on aerobic exercises with target intensity of 60-80 % of work capacity , resistance training and dyspnoea management . 
The control group ( CG , n=37 ) received one individual instruction in exercise training . 
Measurements consisted of : health-related quality of life ( SF36 ) , six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) and lung function ( spirometry ) , assessed three weeks after surgery and after four and twelve months . 
Both groups were comparable at baseline on demographic characteristic and outcome values . 
We found a statistically significant effect after four months in the bodily pain domain of SF36 , with an estimated mean difference ( EMD ) of 15.3 ( 95 % CI:4 to 26.6 , p=0.01 ) and a trend in favour of the intervention for role physical functioning ( EMD 12.04 , 95 % CI : -1 to 25.1 , p=0.07 ) and physical component summary ( EMD 3.76 , 95 % CI : -0.1 to 7.6 , p=0.06 ) . 
At 12 months , the tendency was reversed , with the CG presenting overall slightly better measures . 
We found no effect of the intervention on 6MWT or lung volumes at any time-point . 
Supervised compared to unsupervised exercise training resulted in no improvement in health-related quality of life , except for the bodily pain domain , four months after lung cancer surgery . 
No effects of the intervention were found for any outcome after one year . 
We analyzed the long-term survival of children under 6 years of age ( < 6 years ) enrolled upon the Children 's Cancer Group ( CCG ) -945 high-grade glioma ( HGG ) study to determine the impact of intrinsic biological characteristics as well as treatment upon both survival and quality of life ( QOL ) in this younger age population . 
Analyses were undertaken on patients < 6 years with institutionally diagnosed HGG enrolled on the CCG-945 trial . 
Comparisons of survival were performed for patients < 3 years of age ( < 3 years ) ( treated with intent to avoid irradiation ) versus those between 3 and 6 years of age ( 3-6 years ) ( treated with irradiation and chemotherapy ) at diagnosis . 
Discordance between the institutional diagnoses of HGG and consensus-reviewed diagnoses led us to perform further survival analyses for both groups . 
We compared the two groups of patients for biological markers , and evaluated the neuropsychological and QOL outcomes of long-term survivors . 
Patients < 3 years ( n = 49 , 19.5 % of all enrolled patients ) at diagnosis had a 10-year EFS and OS of 29 ± 6.5 % and 37.5 ± 7 % , respectively , while for patients 3-6 years ( n = 34 , 13.5 % of all enrolled patients ) 10-year EFS and OS were 35 ± 8 % and 36 ± 8 % , respectively . 
Molecular marker analysis showed that a smaller proportion of patients < 3 years harbored TP53 mutations ( P = 0.05 ) . 
Analysis of QOL outcomes with a median length of follow-up of 15.1 years ( 9.5-19.2 ) showed comparable results . 
QOL and survival data were similar for the two groups . 
A larger prospective study is justified to study the efficacy of chemotherapy only regimens in younger children . 
Debilitating hot flushes and sleep dysfunction often affect survivors of breast cancer , most notably in those taking anti-oestrogen medications . 
Conventional treatments have been only partially effective in diminishing these issues , and some have serious risks . 
We did a pilot study to investigate our hypothesis that stellate-ganglion block can be a safe and effective treatment for hot flushes and sleep dysfunction in this patient population . 
13 survivors of breast cancer ( in remission ) with severe hot flushes and night awakenings were treated with stellate-ganglion block at the anterolateral aspect of the C6 vertebra on the right side under fluoroscopy . 
Patients recorded hot flushes in a daily diary by use of the Hot-Flash Score , devised by Sloan and colleagues , and night awakenings by use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . 
Both instruments were used 1 week before the procedure [ A40 ] and then weekly after the procedure for 12 weeks . 
We used the generalised-estimating-equations method to analyse the longitudinal measurements of the number of hot flushes and night awakenings over time . 
This method is a popular approach to analysing datasets that have repeated measures from the same person , and is robust because it does not need the complete distribution of the outcomes to be specified . 
This trial is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number register ( ISRCTN14318565 ) . 
There were no adverse events resulting from the stellate-ganglion block , although patients had temporary Horner 's syndrome indicating the effectiveness of the block . 
Five patients had only one stellate-ganglion block and eight had two stellate-ganglion blocks . 
The total number of hot flushes decreased from a mean of 79.4 ( SD 37.4 ) per week before the procedure to a mean of 49.9 ( SD 39.9 ) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure ( p=0.0002 ) . 
The total number of hot flushes continued to decrease over the remaining follow-up period ( weeks 3-12 ) , and stabilised at a mean of 8.1 ( SD 5.6 ) per week ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
The number of very severe hot flushes was decreased to near zero by the end of the follow-up period ( week 12 ; p < 0.0001 ) . 
Night awakenings decreased from a mean of 19.5 ( SD 14.8 ) per week before the procedure to a mean of 7.3 ( SD 7.1 ) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
The total number of night awakenings continued to decrease over the remaining follow-up period ( weeks 3-12 ) and stabilised at a mean of 1.4 ( SD 1.2 ) per week ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
The findings of this study suggest that stellate-ganglion block can provide survivors of breast cancer with relief from hot flushes and sleep dysfunction with few or no side-effects . 
Long-term relief of symptoms has the potential to improve overall quality of life and increase compliance with anti-oestrogen medications for breast cancer . 
One attempt to improve long-term survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer was thought to be the addition of more non-cross-resistant drugs to platinum-paclitaxel combination regimens . 
Gemcitabine was among the candidates for a third drug . 
We performed a prospective , randomized , phase III , intergroup trial to compare carboplatin plus paclitaxel ( TC ; area under the curve [ AUC ] 5 and 175 mg/m ( 2 ) , respectively ) with the same combination and additional gemcitabine 800 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 and 8 ( TCG ) in previously untreated patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer . 
TC was administered intravenously ( IV ) on day 1 every 21 days for a planned minimum of six courses . 
Gemcitabine was administered by IV on days 1 and 8 of each cycle in the TCG arm . 
Between 2002 and 2004 , 1,742 patients were randomly assigned ; 882 and 860 patients received TC and TCG , respectively . 
Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity and fatigue occurred more frequently in the TCG arm . 
Accordingly , quality-of-life analysis during chemotherapy showed a disadvantage in the TCG arm . 
Although objective response was slightly higher in the TCG arm , this did not translate into improved progression-free survival ( PFS ) or overall survival ( OS ) . 
Median PFS was 17.8 months for the TCG arm and 19.3 months for the TC arm ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 1.18 ; 95 % CI , 1.06 to 1.32 ; P = .0044 ) . 
Median OS was 49.5 for the TCG arm and 51.5 months for the TC arm ( HR , 1.05 ; 95 % CI , 0.91 to 1.20 ; P = .5106 ) . 
The addition of gemcitabine to carboplatin plus paclitaxel increased treatment burden , reduced PFS time , and did not improve OS in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer . 
Therefore , we recommend no additional clinical use of TCG in this population . 
The CO.20 trial randomized patients with K-RAS wild-type , chemotherapy-refractory , metastatic colorectal cancer to receive cetuximab ( CET ) plus brivanib alaninate ( BRIV ) or CET plus placebo ( CET/placebo ) . 
Quality of life ( QoL ) was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , and 24 weeks until disease progression . 
Predefined coprimary QoL endpoints were time to deterioration ( first worsening from baseline of ≥ 10 points ) on the Physical Function ( PF ) and Global ( GHS ) scales . 
Of 750 randomized patients , 721 ( 358 of whom received CET/BRIV ) were assessable for QoL . 
QoL compliance and baseline PF and GHS scores did not differ by treatment arm . 
The median time to deterioration was 1.6 months versus 1.1 months for GHS ( P =.02 ) and 5.6 months versus 1.7 months for PF ( P < .0001 ) favoring CET/placebo . 
Secondary analysis favored CET/placebo for QOL response on the PF , Cognitive Function , Fatigue , Nausea , Appetite , and Diarrhea scales . 
A greater percentage of patients on the CET/BRIV arm had PF worsening at 6 weeks ( 31 % vs 17 % ) . 
Clinical adverse events of ≥ grade 3 were more common with CET/BRIV than with CET/placebo , including fatigue ( 25 % vs 11 % ) , hypertension , rash , diarrhea , abdominal pain , dehydration , and anorexia . 
Compared with CET/placebo , the combination of CET/BRIV worsened time to QoL deterioration for patients with K-RAS wild-type , chemotherapy-refractory , metastatic colorectal cancer on the PF and GHS scales of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 . 
This result may be due to higher rates of fatigue and gastrointestinal adverse events . 
This study sought to continue research on psychosocial interventions for patients being treated with radiation therapy across multiple centers and to replicate positive findings of a single-center study of patients being treated with chemotherapy . 
The primary objective of this study was to determine if a stress management intervention was effective in improving quality of life and decreasing psychological distress in patients undergoing radiotherapy for cancer . 
A total of 310 patients about to begin radiotherapy treatment were randomly assigned to receive usual care only or self-administered stress management training . 
Quality-of-life assessments occurred at baseline and for 3 weeks after the beginning of radiotherapy treatment . 
Overall , patients assigned to receive stress management training did not report significantly less psychological distress on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form ( SF-36 ) Mental Component Summary Scale than did those assigned to usual care . 
When divided into subgroups based on the SF-36 Mental Component Summary Scale scores immediately after their first radiotherapy treatment , patients with above-average levels of psychological distress ( scores < or = 50 ) who were randomly assigned to the intervention condition reported significant improvement in their distress compared with those assigned to usual care only on the SF-36 Mental Health Subscale and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale . 
This study found that self-administered stress management training is effective only in those radiotherapy patients with initially higher levels of psychological distress . 
Additional research should examine the benefits of stress management training targeted specifically to patients experiencing heightened distress . 
Both Billroth I ( B-I ) and Roux-en-Y ( R-Y ) reconstructions are commonly performed as standard procedures , but it has yet to be determined which reconstruction is better for patients . 
A randomized prospective phase II trial with body weight loss at 1 year after surgery as a primary endpoint was performed to address this issue . 
The current report delivers data on the quality of life and degree of postoperative dysfunction , which were the secondary endpoints of this study . 
Gastric cancer patients who underwent distal gastrectomy were intraoperatively randomized to B-I or R-Y . 
Postsurgical QOL was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and DAUGS 20 . 
Between August 2005 and December 2008 , 332 patients were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing B-I versus R-Y . 
A mail survey questionnaire sent to 327 patients was completed by 268 ( 86.2 % ) of them . 
EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were as follows : global health status was similar in each group ( B-I 73.5 ± 18.8 , R-Y 73.2 ± 20.2 , p = 0.87 ) . 
Scores of five functional scales were also similar . 
Only the dyspnea symptom scale showed superior results for R-Y than for B-I ( B-I 13.6 ± 17.9 , R-Y 8.6 ± 16.3 , p = 0.02 ) . 
With respect to DAUGS 20 , the total score did not differ significantly between the R-Y and B-I groups ( 24.8 vs. 23.6 , p = 0.41 ) . 
Only reflux symptoms were significantly worse for B-I than for R-Y ( 0.7 ± 0.6 vs. 0.5 ± 0.6 , p = 0.01 ) . 
The B-I and R-Y techniques were generally equivalent in terms of postoperative QOL and dysfunction . 
Both procedures seem acceptable as standard reconstructions after distal gastrectomy with regard to postoperative QOL and dysfunction . 
Delirium is a serious and common postoperative complication , especially in frail elderly patients . 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric liaison intervention in comparison with standard care on the incidence of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients treated with an elective surgical procedure for a solid tumour . 
Patients over 65 years of age who were undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour were recruited to a multicentre , prospective , randomized , controlled trial . 
The patients were randomized to standard treatment versus a geriatric liaison intervention . 
The intervention consisted of a preoperative geriatric consultation , an individual treatment plan targeted at risk factors for delirium , daily visits by a geriatric nurse during the hospital stay and advice on managing any problems encountered . 
The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative delirium . 
The secondary outcome measures were the severity of delirium , length of hospital stay , complications , mortality , care dependency , quality of life , return to an independent preoperative living situation and additional care at home . 
In total , the data of 260 patients were analysed . 
Delirium occurred in 31 patients ( 11.9 % ) , and there was no significant difference between the incidence of delirium in the intervention group and the usual-care group ( 9.4 % vs. 14.3 % , OR : 0.63 , 95 % CI : 0.29-1.35 ) . 
Within this study , a geriatric liaison intervention based on frailty for the prevention of postoperative delirium in frail elderly cancer patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid tumour has not proven to be effective . 
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of gefitinib ( Iressa [ ZD1839 ] ; AstraZeneca , Wilmington , DE ) , a novel epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , in patients with pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . 
This was a randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter phase II trial . 
Two hundred ten patients with advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with one or two chemotherapy regimens ( at least one containing platinum ) were randomly assigned to receive either 250-mg or 500-mg oral doses of gefitinib once daily . 
Efficacy was similar for the 250- and 500-mg/d groups . 
Objective tumor response rates were 18.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 11.5 to 27.3 ) and 19.0 % ( 95 % CI , 12.1 to 27.9 ) ; among evaluable patients , symptom improvement rates were 40.3 % ( 95 % CI , 28.5 to 53.0 ) and 37.0 % ( 95 % CI , 26.0 to 49.1 ) ; median progression-free survival times were 2.7 and 2.8 months ; and median overall survival times were 7.6 and 8.0 months , respectively . 
Symptom improvements were recorded for 69.2 % ( 250 mg/d ) and 85.7 % ( 500 mg/d ) of patients with a tumor response . 
Adverse events ( AEs ) at both dose levels were generally mild ( grade 1 or 2 ) and consisted mainly of skin reactions and diarrhea . 
Drug-related toxicities were more frequent in the higher-dose group . 
Withdrawal due to drug-related AEs was 1.9 % and 9.4 % for patients receiving gefitinib 250 and 500 mg/d , respectively . 
Gefitinib showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity and provided symptom relief as second- and third-line treatment in these patients . 
At 250 mg/d , gefitinib had a favorable AE profile . 
Gefitinib 250 mg/d is an important , novel treatment option for patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC . 
Data from experimental studies suggest that octreotide , the long acting somatostatin analogue , improves survival of animals with pancreatic cancer . 
To assess the antitumour effect of octreotide , a randomized trial was performed comparing octreotide with supportive care in advanced pancreatic cancer patients . 
All patients , aged 59-75 years , were not liable to radical surgical treatment and were not submitted to other treatments ( chemo and/or radiotherapy ) . 
Six patients were enrolled , 4 of these treated with octreotide ( 500 micrograms two times a day subcutaneous for six months ) and the other 2 were inserted a control group . 
The patients treated with octreotide showed a significant advantage in quality of life ( restored appetite , improvement of digestion and intestine function , remission of abdominal pain and preservation of baseline body weight ) with a mean > 80 of karnofsky performance score . 
Monitoring of tumour size changes ( US-TC ) over the 6 months study period , showed slackened neoplastic growth in all treated patients , whereas neoplasm grew according to an almost exponential trend in untreated patients . 
Also survival was better in treated patients : in particular , 2 patients out of 4 who completed the study underwent follow-up until they died 12 and 16 months after beginning of treatment , respectively . 
Karnofsky performance score was particularly high in both patients . 
This supports the view that octreotide is endowed with antiproliferative activity . 
In conclusion octreotide therapy seems to confer a survival benefit and a better quality of life in advanced pancreatic tumour . 
Additional studies are needed to confirm these results and to clarify other questions about dose and somatostatin receptors in this kind of tumour . 
To determine the safety and efficacy of oral bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ; Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated , San Diego , Calif ) . 
The effects of 2 randomized doses of 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( with crossover for progression ) vs 650 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( later modified to 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ) were evaluated in an open-label , multicenter , phase 2 and 3 study conducted between February 1997 and November 1998 . 
Eighteen international cutaneous T-cell lymphoma clinics at academic referral centers . 
Fifty-eight patients with biopsy-proven stage IA through IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that was refractory to ( or patients were intolerant of ) treatment or had reached at least a 6-month response plateau under at least 2 forms of prior therapy ( median of 3.5 prior therapies ) . 
Bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ) administered once daily with meal for 16 weeks or longer . 
Primary end point classification of overall response rate of complete and partial remissions determined by either the Physician 's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition or the objective Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity . 
Body surface area , time to response , duration of disease control , time to disease progression , individual index lesion signs and symptoms , and quality of life parameters were secondary outcomes . 
Responses ( > or = 50 % improvement ) were seen in 3 ( 20 % ) of 15 patients with an initial dose at 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 % -40 % ) , 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients at 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % CI , 35 % -72 % ) , and 10 ( 67 % ) of 15 patients at above 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % CI , 43 % -91 % ) . 
The rate of progressive disease was 47 % , 21 % , and 13 % at the same dose levels , respectively . 
Eight ( 73 % ) of 11 patients crossing over from 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day to higher doses subsequently responded . 
The median duration of response from start of therapy could not be estimated for the 15 patients at 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day owing to low relapse rates in 2 patients ( 13 % ) ; at higher doses it was 516 days . 
The following drug-related adverse effects were reversible and treatable : hypertriglyceridemia ( 46 patients [ 79 % ] ) , hypercholesterolemia ( 28 patients [ 48 % ] ) , headache ( 27 patients [ 47 % ] ) , central hypothyroidism ( 23 patients [ 40 % ] ) , asthenia ( 21 patients [ 36 % ] ) , and leukopenia ( 16 patients [ 28 % ] ) . 
No cases of drug-related neutropenic fever , sepsis , or death occurred . 
Pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients with triglyceride levels higher than 14.69 mmol/L ( 1300 mg/dL ) , all of whom were taking 300 mg/m ( 2 ) or more of oral bexarotene per day . 
Bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ) ( the first retinoid X receptor-selective rexinoid ) was well tolerated and effective as an oral treatment for 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients with refractory or persistent early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at doses of 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day . 
Hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism require monitoring but are reversible and manageable with concomitant medication . 
The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a structured , multidisciplinary intervention targeted to maintain the overall quality of life ( QOL ) , which is more comprehensive than psychosocial distress , of patients undergoing radiation therapy for advanced-stage cancer . 
Radiation therapy patients with advanced cancer and an estimated 5-year survival rate of 0 % to 50 % were randomly assigned to either an eight-session structured multidisciplinary intervention arm or a standard care arm . 
The eight 90-minute sessions addressed the five domains of QOL including cognitive , physical , emotional , spiritual , and social functioning . 
The primary end point of maintaining overall QOL was assessed by a single-item linear analog scale ( Linear Analog Scale of Assessment or modified Spitzer Uniscale ) . 
QOL was assessed at baseline , week 4 ( end of multidisciplinary intervention ) , week 8 , and week 27 . 
Of the 103 participants , overall QOL at week 4 was maintained by the patients in the intervention ( n = 49 ) , whereas QOL at week 4 significantly decreased for patients in the control group ( n = 54 ) . 
This change reflected a 3-point increase from baseline in the intervention group and a 9-point decrease from baseline in the control group ( P = .009 ) . 
Intervention participants maintained their QOL , and controls gradually returned to baseline by the end of the 6-month follow-up period . 
Although intervention participants maintained and actually improved their QOL during radiation therapy , control participants experienced a significant decrease in their QOL . 
Thus , a structured multidisciplinary intervention can help maintain or even improve QOL in patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing cancer treatment . 
Major depressive disorder develops in up to half the patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer , resulting in significant morbidity ; therefore , preventing depression during cancer treatment may be of great benefit . 
To determine whether prophylactic use of the antidepressant escitalopram oxalate would decrease the incidence of depression in patients receiving primary therapy for head and neck cancer . 
A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram vs placebo was conducted in a group of nondepressed patients diagnosed as having head and neck cancer who were about to enter cancer treatment . 
Patients were stratified by sex , site , stage ( early vs advanced ) , and primary modality of treatment ( radiation vs surgery ) . 
The primary outcome measure was the number of participants who developed moderate or greater depression ( scores on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology-Self Rated of ≥11 ) . 
From January 6 , 2008 , to December 28 , 2011 , 148 patients were randomized . 
Significantly fewer patients receiving escitalopram developed depression ( 24.6 % in the placebo group vs 10.0 % in the escitalopram group ; stratified log-rank test , P = .04 ) . 
A Cox proportional hazards regression model compared the 2 treatment groups after controlling for age , baseline smoking status , and stratification variables . 
The hazard ratio of 0.37 ( 95 % CI , 0.14-0.96 ) demonstrated an advantage of escitalopram ( P = .04 ) . 
Patients undergoing radiotherapy as the initial modality were significantly more likely to develop depression than those undergoing surgery ( radiotherapy compared with surgery group ; hazard ratio , 3.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.38-9.40 ; P = .009 ) . 
Patients in the escitalopram group who completed the study and were not depressed rated their overall quality of life as significantly better for 3 consecutive months after cessation of drug use . 
In nondepressed patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer , prophylactic escitalopram reduced the risk of developing depression by more than 50 % . 
In nondepressed patients who completed the trial , quality of life was also significantly better for 3 consecutive months after cessation of drug use in the escitalopram group . 
These findings have important implications for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer . 
In a prospective randomized study , 287 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) stage IIIb or IV with ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0-1 or 2 were randomly assigned to receive either best supportive care ( BSC ) or supportive care plus combination chemotherapy ( IEP regimen : ifosfamide 3 gm/m2 IV with mesna uroprotection , epirubicin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 2 ; or MVP regimen : mitomycin-C 8 mg/m2 , cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on day 1 , vinblastine 4 mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 15 ) . 
Serial assessment of Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) , modified Functional Living Index-Cancer ( T-FLIC ) and modified Quality of Life-Index ( T-QLI ) were used to estimate the quality of life . 
Interviews were done at entry , at the third month and at 2 months post complete treatment . 
At least two courses of chemotherapy were considered to be adequate for response evaluation . 
Patients were treated for a total of four to six courses or until progression of disease . 
Partial response rates were 40 and 41.7 % in IEP and MVP arms . 
Median survival durations were 5.9 and 8.1 months for the IEP and MVP chemotherapy arms , and 4.1 months for BSC ( log-rank test : P = 0.0003 ) . 
One year survival was 13 , 29.8 and 39.3 % for the BSC , IEP and MVP regimens , respectively . 
Two years survival was 7.8 , 6.4 and 13.1 % for the BSC , IEP and MVP regimens , respectively . 
Improvement in quality of life ( QOL ) scores at the first , second and third interview were seen in chemotherapy arms only , not in the BSC arm . 
We conclude that combination chemotherapy improves the quality of life as well as prolonging the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC . 
Low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis prevents a definitive stoma in patients with distal rectal cancer . 
However , imperative stool urge , stool fragmentation , prolonged stooling sessions , and minor problems of incontinence are frequently observed in the postoperative situation and negatively affect quality of life . 
Therefore , the colonic J-pouch was originally constructed to create a stool reservoir . 
In a randomized , prospective study , the short ( 5 cm ) colonic J-pouch was tested for function and continence vs. straight coloanal anastomosis . 
Over a period of 30 months , 74 consecutive patients ( 55 males ) with rectal cancer in the lower and middle third of the rectum were included and randomized into two groups . 
Anastomosis was performed either as a coloanal or a colon-pouch-anal anastomosis . 
The standardized surgical procedure included mobilization of the left hemicolon , central ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery and vein , preaortal lymph node dissection , autonomic nerve preservation , and total mesorectal excision . 
The anastomosis was performed at the upper anal canal or at the intersphincteric level . 
All patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively for fecal continence , including sphincter manometry and defecation habits . 
In addition , quality of life was determined by use of a standardized questionnaire ( European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer , EORTC-QLQ-C30 ) . 
Thirty-seven patients were randomized into each group . 
In general , problems with continence for liquids or gas occurred less frequently in the colonic J-pouch group 6 months after surgery . 
The frequency of bowel movements was lower in the J-pouch group ( 2.5 per day ) than in the coloanal group ( 4.7 per day ) . 
Importantly , in a manometric study at the same postoperative point , neorectal capacity was decreased to a similar degree in both groups compared with the preoperative rectal volume . 
Thus , the expected and postulated reservoir effect could not be achieved by forming a 5-cm colonic J-pouch . 
The colonic J-pouch was superior with regard to continence for gas and liquids compared with a straight coloanal anastomosis . 
Furthermore , stool frequency was significantly lower in the J-pouch group than in the coloanal reconstruction group . 
However , because neorectal capacity decreased equally in both groups , we speculate that the advantage of the colonic J-pouch is not in the creation of a larger neorectal reservoir but rather may be related to decreased motility . 
Non-randomised studies have suggested that the postoperative complications of ( Campos LS , Limberger LF , Stein AT , Kalil AN ) laparoscopic radical hysterectomy are similar to those in abdominal radical hysterectomy . 
However , no study evaluating postoperative pain comparing both techniques has been published thus far . 
Our objective was to compare pain intensity and other perioperative outcomes between laparoscopic radical hysterectomy ( LRH ) and abdominal radical hysterectomy ( ARH ) in early cervical cancer . 
This single centre , randomised , controlled trial enrolled 30 cervical cancer patients who were clinically staged IA2 with lymph vascular invasion and IB according to the FIGO ( International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics ) classification , and underwent LRH or ARH between late 1999 and early 2004 . 
Postoperative pain , as measured by a 10-point numerical rate scale , was considered the primary endpoint . 
Postoperative pain was assessed every six hours during a patient 's usual postoperative care . 
Perioperative outcomes were also registered . 
Both surgical techniques were executed by the same surgical team . 
Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and other postoperative surgicopathological factors and 5-year survival rates . 
IA2 patients with lymphatic vascular space invasion and IB cervical cancer patients were randomised to either the LRH group ( 16 patients ) or the ARH group ( 14 patients ) . 
Four patients ( 25 % ) in the LRH group and 5 patients ( 36 % ) in the ARH group presented with transoperative or serious postoperative complications . 
All of the transoperative complications occurred in the LRH group . 
The relative risk of presenting with complications was 0.70 ; CI 95 % ( 0.23-2.11 ) ; P = 0.694 . 
LRH group mean pain score was significantly lower than ARH after 36 h of observation ( P = 0.044 ; mean difference score : 1.42 ; 95 % CI : 0.04-2.80 ) . 
The survival results will be published elsewhere . 
LRH provided lower pain scores after 36 h of observation in this series . 
The perioperative and serious postoperative complications ratios were comparable between the groups . 
Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms experienced by patients with cancer . 
This trial was developed to evaluate the efficacy of long-acting methylphenidate for improving cancer-related fatigue and to assess its toxicities . 
Adults with cancer were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to receive methylphenidate ( target dose , 54 mg/d ) or placebo for 4 weeks . 
The Brief Fatigue Inventory was the primary outcome measure , while secondary outcome measures included a Symptom Experience Diary ( SED ) , the Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) Vitality Subscale , a linear analog self-assessment , the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , and the Subject Global Impression of Change . 
In total , 148 patients were enrolled . 
Using an area under the serum concentration-time curve analysis , there was no evidence that methylphenidate , as compared with placebo , improved the primary end point of cancer-related fatigue in this patient population ( P = .35 ) . 
Comparisons of secondary end points , including clinically significant changes in quality-of-life variables and cancer-related fatigue change from baseline , were similarly negative . 
However , a subset analysis suggested that patients with more severe fatigue and/or with more advanced disease did have some fatigue improvement with methylphenidate ( eg , in patients with stage III or IV disease , the mean improvement in usual fatigue was 19.7 with methylphenidate v 2.1 with placebo ; P = .02 ) . 
There was a significant difference in self-reported toxicities ( SED ) , with increased levels of nervousness and appetite loss in the methylphenidate arm . 
This clinical trial was unable to support the primary prestudy hypothesis that the chosen long-acting methylphenidate product would decrease cancer-related fatigue . 
In 1980 the EORTC-BCCG initiated a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing modified radical mastectomy ( MRM ) with breast-conserving therapy ( BCT ) in stage I and II breast cancer . 
The main endpoint of the trial was survival . 
A brief quality of life ( QoL ) questionnaire consisting of two multi-item scales ( body image and fear of recurrence ) and two single items ( satisfaction with treatment and cosmetic result ) was included in the trial . 
A cosmetic evaluation of the breast after conservative surgery was also performed . 
This report concentrates on the results of the QoL study and the cosmetic evaluation . 
Multitrait scaling analysis was employed to verify the hypothesised scale structure of the questionnaire . 
Treatment comparison of the QoL scores at 2 years post-treatment was performed using a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test . 
Both patients ' and doctors ' ratings of the cosmetic result were documented on the clinical follow-up form . 
A multivariate analysis was performed to identify which factors influenced the cosmetic outcome . 
In total , 127 patients in the MRM arm and 151 in the BCT arm completed a QoL questionnaire at approximately 2 years after randomisation ( months 25-36 ) . 
The Cronbach 's alpha coefficients were 0.79 and 0.73 for the body image and fear of recurrence scales , respectively . 
Significant benefit in body image and satisfaction with treatment was observed in the BCT patients . 
No significant difference was observed in fear of recurrence between the two groups . 
Ratings of cosmetic results decreased with time , in line with clinical observations of long-term side-effects of radiotherapy . 
Wide excision appeared to be the most important predictive factor for poor cosmetic result . 
In this multicentre randomised study , BCT helped to maintain the patients ' body image , resulted in higher satisfaction with treatment and yielded no significant difference from MRM with respect to fear of recurrence . 
To assess the cost-effectiveness of Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS ) compared with the surgical excision for both primary and recurrent basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) . 
A cost-effectiveness study performed alongside a prospective randomized clinical trial in which MMS was compared with surgical excision . 
The study was carried out from 1999 to 2002 at the dermatology outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Maastricht , Maastricht , The Netherlands . 
A total of 408 primary ( 374 patients ) and 204 recurrent ( 191 patients ) cases of facial BCC were included . 
The mean total treatment costs of MMS and surgical excision for both primary and recurrent BCC and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio , calculated as the difference in costs between MMS and surgical excision divided by their difference in effectiveness . 
The resulting ratio is defined as the incremental costs of MMS compared with surgical excision to prevent 1 additional recurrence . 
Compared with surgical excision , the total treatment costs of MMS are significantly higher ( cost difference : primary BCC , 254 euros ; 95 % confidence interval , 181-324 euros ; recurrent BCC , 249 euros ; 95 % confidence interval , 175-323 euros ) . 
For primary BCC , the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 29,231 euros , while the ratio for recurrent BCC amounted to 8094 euros . 
The acceptability curves showed that for these ratios , the probability of MMS being more cost-effective than surgical excision never reached 50 % . 
At present , it does not seem cost-effective to introduce MMS on a large scale for both primary and recurrent BCC . 
However , because a 5-year period is normally required to determine definite recurrence rates , it is possible that MMS may become a cost-effective treatment for recurrent BCC . 
The aim of this study was determine the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based stress-reduction ( MBSR ) program on quality of life ( QOL ) and psychosocial outcomes in women with early-stage breast cancer , using a three-arm randomized controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) . 
This RCT consisting of 172 women , aged 20-65 with stage I or II breast cancer consisted of the 8-week MBSR , which was compared to a nutrition education program ( NEP ) and usual supportive care ( UC ) . 
Follow-up was performed at three post-intervention points : 4 months , 1 , and 2 years . 
Standardized , validated self-administered questionnaires were adopted to assess psychosocial variables . 
Statistical analysis included descriptive and regression analyses incorporating both intention-to-treat and post hoc multivariable approaches of the 163 women with complete data at baseline , those who were randomized to MBSR experienced a significant improvement in the primary measures of QOL and coping outcomes compared to the NEP , UC , or both , including the spirituality subscale of the FACT-B as well as dealing with illness scale increases in active behavioral coping and active cognitive coping . 
Secondary outcome improvements resulting in significant between-group contrasts favoring the MBSR group at 4 months included meaningfulness , depression , paranoid ideation , hostility , anxiety , unhappiness , and emotional control . 
Results tended to decline at 12 months and even more at 24 months , though at all times , they were as robust in women with lower expectation of effect as in those with higher expectation . 
The MBSR intervention appears to benefit psychosocial adjustment in cancer patients , over and above the effects of usual care or a credible control condition . 
The universality of effects across levels of expectation indicates a potential to utilize this stress reduction approach as complementary therapy in oncologic practice . 
In an international , randomized phase III trial , sunitinib demonstrated statistically significant efficacy over interferon alfa ( IFN-alpha ) as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) ( progression-free survival time , 11 v 5 months , respectively ; P < .001 ; objective response rate , 31 % v 6 % , respectively ; P < .001 ) . 
We report health-related quality-of-life ( QOL ) results from this trial . 
Seven hundred fifty mRCC patients were randomly assigned to sunitinib ( 6-week cycles : 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks , followed by 2 weeks off ) or IFN-alpha ( 9 million units subcutaneous injections , three times weekly ) . 
QOL measures included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) , the FACT-Kidney Symptom Index-15 item ( FKSI-15 ) , and the EuroQoL-5D 's utility score ( EQ-5D Index ) and its visual analog scale ( EQ-VAS ) . 
The primary QOL end point was the FKSI Disease-Related Symptoms ( FKSI-DRS ) subscale . 
Higher scores indicated better outcomes ( better QOL or fewer symptoms ) . 
Data were analyzed for the intent-to-treat population using mixed-effects models , supplemented with pattern-mixture models . 
Patients receiving sunitinib reported higher FKSI-15 and FKSI-DRS scores at each cycle than those receiving IFN-alpha , with a significant difference in the overall least squares means ( 3.27 and 1.98 , respectively ; P < .0001 ) . 
Similarly , differences in least squares means for FACT-G ( and all subscales ) , EQ-5D Index , and EQ-VAS were all significantly favorable for sunitinib ( P < .01 ) . 
Per pre-established thresholds , between-treatment differences in the mean scores were clinically meaningful after cycle 4 for FKSI-DRS and at all assessments for FKSI-15 , FACT-G , and the FACT-G functional well-being subscale . 
Sunitinib provides superior QOL compared with IFN-alpha in mRCC patients . 
The Medical Research Council CR07/National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group C016 ( MRC CR07/NCIC CTG C016 ) trial showed that , in patients with operable rectal cancer , short-course preoperative radiotherapy ( PRE ) reduced the rate of local recurrence compared with surgery followed by selective postoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with a positive circumferential resection margin . 
However , the advantages of giving PRE to all patients needs to be balanced against any negative impact on patients ' quality of life . 
All 1,350 patients were asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item ( MOS SF-36 ) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorectal 38-item ( EORTC QLQ-CR38 ) questionnaires . 
A priori hypotheses related to the impact of treatment on sexual , bowel , and physical function and general health . 
Male sexual dysfunction was significantly increased following surgery ( P < .001 ) , although there was no difference between treatment arms . 
However , a treatment difference had emerged at 6 months ( PRE patients reporting significantly greater dysfunction ; P = .004 ) , which persisted out to at least 2 years ( an insufficient number of female patients completed the sexual dysfunction questions to draw firm conclusions ) . 
Both treatment groups reported similar levels of decreased physical function at 3 months , but thereafter it returned to baseline levels . 
There was no evidence of any major changes between treatments or time points in terms of general health or bowel function , but exploratory analysis indicated a significant ( P = .006 at 2 years ) increase in the level of fecal incontinence with PRE . 
These results from a large randomized trial using validated patient-completed questionnaires show that , for males , the main adverse effect was sexual dysfunction , and the main cause of this was surgery , but that PRE also affected sexual and some aspects of bowel functioning . 
Persistent insomnia is a common complaint in cancer survivors , but is seldom satisfactorily addressed . 
The adaptation to cancer care of a validated , cost-effective intervention may offer a practicable solution . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of protocol-driven cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for insomnia , delivered by oncology nurses . 
Randomized , controlled , pragmatic , two-center trial of CBT versus treatment as usual ( TAU ) in 150 patients ( 103 females ; mean age , 61 years . ) 
who had completed active therapy for breast , prostate , colorectal , or gynecological cancer . 
The study conformed to CONSORT guidelines . 
Primary outcomes were sleep diary measures at baseline , post-treatment , and 6-month follow-up . 
Actigraphic sleep , health-related quality of life ( QOL ) , psychopathology , and fatigue were secondary measures . 
CBT comprised five , small group sessions across consecutive weeks , after a manualized protocol . 
TAU represented normal clinical practice ; the appropriate control for a clinical effectiveness study . 
CBT was associated with mean reductions in wakefulness of 55 minutes per night compared with no change in TAU . 
These outcomes were sustained 6 months after treatment . 
Standardized relative effect sizes were large for complaints of difficulty initiating sleep , waking from sleep during the night , and for sleep efficiency ( percentage of time in bed spent asleep ) . 
CBT was associated with moderate to large effect sizes for five of seven QOL outcomes , including significant reduction in daytime fatigue . 
There was no significant interaction effect between any of these outcomes and baseline demographic , clinical , or sleep characteristics . 
CBT for insomnia may be both clinically effective and feasible to deliver in real world practice . 
Performance status ( PS ) 2 patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) experience more toxicity , lower response rates , and shorter survival times than healthier patients treated with standard chemotherapy . 
Paclitaxel poliglumex ( PPX ) , a macromolecule drug conjugate of paclitaxel and polyglutamic acid , reduces systemic exposure to peak concentrations of free paclitaxel and may lead to increased concentrations in tumors due to enhanced vascular permeability . 
Chemotherapy-naive PS 2 patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive carboplatin ( area under the curve = 6 ) and either PPX ( 210 mg/m/10 min without routine steroid premedication ) or paclitaxel ( 225 mg/m/3 h with standard premedication ) every 3 weeks . 
The primary end point was overall survival . 
A total of 400 patients were enrolled . 
Alopecia , arthralgias/myalgias , and cardiac events were significantly less frequent with PPX/carboplatin , whereas grade > or =3 neutropenia and grade 3 neuropathy showed a trend of worsening . 
There was no significant difference in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions despite the absence of routine premedication in the PPX arm . 
Overall survival was similar between treatment arms ( hazard ratio , 0.97 ; log rank p = 0.769 ) . 
Median and 1-year survival rates were 7.9 months and 31 % , for PPX versus 8 months and 31 % for paclitaxel . 
Disease control rates were 64 % and 69 % for PPX and paclitaxel , respectively . 
Time to progression was similar : 3.9 months for PPX/carboplatin versus 4.6 months for paclitaxel/carboplatin ( p = 0.210 ) . 
PPX/carboplatin failed to provide superior survival compared with paclitaxel/carboplatin in the first-line treatment of PS 2 patients with NSCLC , but the results with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival were comparable and the PPX regimen was more convenient . 
To investigate the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin ( epoetin beta ) on anemia , transfusion need , and quality of life ( QOL ) in severely anemic patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , or multiple myeloma ( MM ) . 
Transfusion-dependent patients with NHL ( n = 106 ) , CLL ( n = 126 ) , or MM ( n = 117 ) and a low serum erythropoietin concentration were randomized to receive epoetin beta 150 IU/kg or placebo subcutaneously three times a week for 16 weeks . 
Primary efficacy criteria were transfusion-free and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival ( hemoglobin [ Hb ] > 8.5 g/dL ) between weeks 5 to 16 . 
Response was defined as an increase in Hb > or = 2 g/dL with elimination of transfusion need . 
QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale . 
Transfusion-free ( P =.0012 ) survival and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival ( P =.0001 ) were significantly greater in the epoetin beta group versus placebo ( Wald chi ( 2 ) test ) , giving a relative risk reduction of 43 % and 51 % , respectively . 
The response rate was 67 % and 27 % in the epoetin beta versus the placebo group , respectively ( P < .0001 ) . 
After 12 and 16 weeks of treatment , QOL significantly improved in the epoetin beta group compared with placebo ( P < .05 ) ; this improvement correlated with an increase in Hb concentration ( > or = 2 g/dL ) . 
A target Hb that could be generally recommended could not be identified . 
Many severely anemic and transfusion-dependent patients with advanced MM , NHL , and CLL and a low performance status benefited from epoetin therapy , with elimination of severe anemia and transfusion need , and improvement in QOL . 
The Australian and New Zealand Germ Cell Trials Group conducted a multicenter randomized phase III trial in men with good-prognosis germ cell tumors of two standard chemotherapy regimens that contained bleomycin , etoposide , and cisplatin but differed in the scheduling and total dose of cisplatin , the total dose of bleomycin , and the scheduling and dose intensity of etoposide . 
The trial was stopped early at a median follow-up of 33 months after a planned interim analysis found a survival benefit for the more dose-intense regimen . 
The aim of this analysis was to determine if this survival benefit was maintained with long-term follow-up . 
Between February 1994 and April 2000 , 166 men with good-prognosis metastatic germ cell tumors defined by modified Memorial Sloan-Kettering criteria were randomly assigned to receive 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P ( three cycles , repeated every 21 days , of 30 kU bleomycin on days 1 , 8 , and 15 ; 100 mg/m ( 2 ) etoposide on days 1-5 ; and 20 mg/m ( 2 ) cisplatin on days 1-5 ; n = 83 ) or 4B ( 30 ) E ( 360 ) P ( four cycles , repeated every 21 days , of 30 kU bleomycin on day 1 , 120 mg/m ( 2 ) etoposide on days 1-3 , and 100 mg/m ( 2 ) cisplatin on day 1 ; n = 83 ) . 
Endpoints included overall survival , progression-free survival , and quality of life and side effects , which were assessed using the Spitzer Quality of Life Index and the GLQ-8 , respectively , before random assignment and during and after treatment . 
All analyses were by intention to treat . 
All P values are two-sided . 
The median follow-up was 8.5 years . 
All but five survivors ( 3 % ) were followed up for at least 5 years . 
Overall survival remained better in those assigned to 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P than in those assigned to 4B ( 30 ) E ( 360 ) P ( 8-year survival : 92 % vs 83 % ; hazard ratio of death = 0.38 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.15 to 0.97 , P = .037 ) . 
Progression-free survival favored 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P but was not statistically significantly different between the treatment groups ( 8-year progression-free survival , 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P vs 4B ( 30 ) E ( 360 ) P : 86 % vs 79 % ; hazard ratio of progression = 0.6 , 95 % confidence interval = 0.3 to 1.1 , P = .15 ) . 
At the end of treatment , average scores for most side effect scales favored 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P. After the completion of treatment , average GLQ-8 scores for numbness ( P = .003 ) and hair loss ( P = .04 ) and the Spitzer Quality of Life Index ( P = .05 ) favored 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P. The survival benefit of 3B ( 90 ) E ( 500 ) P over 4B ( 30 ) E ( 360 ) P was maintained with long-term follow-up . 
To assess comparatively , in terms of quality-adjusted survival , three front-line treatments in patients with stage B- or C-chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . 
To describe better and compare the survival after randomization of patients from the CLL90 trial that randomly compared ChOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , oncovin , prednisone ) , CAP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , prednisone ) and fludarabine in advanced CLL , we performed a quality-adjusted survival analysis . 
This consisted of defining four clinical states ( toxicity , treatment free of toxicity , no treatment nor symptoms , relapse ) , then summing up the average times spent in each state weighted by utility coefficients that reflect relative value according to quality of life . 
The resulting quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity ( Q-TWIST ) was compared between randomized groups , and sensitivity ( threshold ) analyses to the choice of utility coefficients was performed . 
Over 73 months after randomization , the fludarabine group gained a mean of 45 days of toxicity-free survival at CAP , and 61 days over ChOP . 
The mean TWIST was 27.05 months with CAP , 31.5 months with ChOP and 32.95 months with fludarabine . 
The threshold analyses showed that , whatever the utility weights , the mean Q-TWIST was always greater with ChOP or fludarabine as compared to CAP . 
Fludarabine was consistently a better treatment than ChOP , except in the unlikely case of high utility weights attributed to toxicity and low utility weights attributed to treatment . 
Nevertheless , from a clinical point of view , differences between ChOP and fludarabine were moderate or event slight ( mean difference in TWIST of 1.45 months ) . 
We conclude that patients with advanced CLL have a moderate benefit in terms of Q-TWIST when treated with fludarabine over ChOP . 
These two treatments are always superior to CAP . 
There will be a detectable increase in overall survival ( OS ) using preoperative ( PRE ) as opposed to perioperative ( PERI ) chemotherapy in resectable StageI-II non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . 
This multicenter , open-label , randomised trial with a 2×2 factorial design first compared two chemotherapy strategies ( PRE versus PERI ) , then two chemotherapy regimens ( gemcitabine-cisplatin [ GP ] versus paclitaxel-carboplatin [ TC ] ) . 
The PRE group received two preoperative cycles followed by two additional preoperative cycles , while the PERI group underwent two preoperative cycles followed by two postoperative cycles , the 3rd and 4th cycles being given only to responders in both cases . 
A total of 528 patients were randomised , 267 of which were assigned to the PRE group and 261 to the PERI group . 
Three-year OS did not differ between the two groups ( 67.4 % and 67.7 % , respectively ; hazard ratio ( HR ) =1.01 [ 0.79-1.30 ] , p=0.92 ) , nor did 3-year disease-free survival , response rates , toxicity , or postoperative mortality . 
Pathological complete response was observed in 22 ( 8.2 % ) and 16 patients ( 6.1 % ) , respectively . 
Although quality of life did not differ significantly , chemotherapy compliance was significantly higher in the PRE group . 
The proportion of responders who received Cycles 3 and 4 was significantly higher in the PRE group ( 90.4 % versus 75.2 % , p=0.001 ) . 
In responders , the dose intensity of Cycles 3 and 4 was higher in the PRE group than in the PERI group ( mean relative dose intensity of 90.4 % versus 82.6 % , respectively ; p=0.0007 ) . 
There was no difference between GP and TC in 3-year OS ( HR=0.97 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0.76-1.25 ] , p=0.80 ) or response rates . 
However , the regimens ' toxicity profiles differed . 
This study failed to demonstrate any difference in survival between patients receiving preoperative and perioperative chemotherapy in early-stage NSCLC . 
The increase from two to four preoperative chemotherapy cycles did not increase the pathological response rate . 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a slow-release formulation of cytarabine ( DepoCyt ; Chiron Corp , Emeryville , CA , and Skye Pharma , Inc , San Diego , CA ) that maintains cytotoxic concentrations of cytarabine ( ara-C ) in the CSF of most patients for more than 14 days . 
Twenty-eight patients with lymphoma and a positive CSF cytology were randomized to receive DepoCyt 50 mg once every 2 weeks or free ara-C 50 mg twice a week for 1 month . 
Patients whose CSF cytology converted to negative and who did not have neurologic progression received an additional 3 months of consolidation therapy and then 4 months of maintenance therapy . 
All patients received dexamethasone 4 mg orally bid on days 1 through 5 of each 2-week cycle . 
The response rate was 71 % for DepoCyt and 15 % for ara-C on an intent-to-treat basis ( P =.006 ) . 
All of the patients on the DepoCyt arm but only 53 % of those on the ara-C arm were able to complete the planned 1-month induction therapy regimen . 
Time to neurologic progression and survival trend in favor of DepoCyt ( median , 78.5 v 42 days and 99.5 v 63 days , respectively ; P > .05 ) . 
DepoCyt treatment was associated with an improved mean change in Karnofsky performance score at the end of induction ( P =.041 ) . 
The major adverse events on both arms were headache and arachnoiditis , which were often caused by the underlying disease . 
DepoCyt injected once every 2 weeks produced a high response rate and a better quality of life as measured by Karnofsky score relative to that produced by free ara-C injected twice a week . 
Patients receiving chemoradiation for cervical cancer are at risk for distress , chemoradiation-related side-effects , and immunosuppression . 
This prospective randomized clinical trial examined effects of a complementary therapy , Healing Touch ( HT ) , versus relaxation training ( RT ) and usual care ( UC ) for ( 1 ) supporting cellular immunity , ( 2 ) improving mood and quality of life ( QOL ) , and ( 3 ) reducing treatment-associated toxicities and treatment delay in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiation . 
Sixty women with stages IB1 to IVA cervical cancer were randomly assigned to receive UC or 4 ×/weekly individual sessions of either HT or RT immediately following radiation during their 6-week chemoradiation treatment . 
Patients completed psychosocial assessments and blood sampling before chemoradiation at baseline , weeks 4 and 6 . 
Multilevel regression analyses using orthogonal contrasts tested for differences between treatment conditions over time . 
HT patients had a minimal decrease in natural killer cell cytotoxicity ( NKCC ) over the course of treatment whereas NKCC of RT and UC patients declined sharply during chemoradiation ( group by time interaction : p = 0.018 ) . 
HT patients showed greater decreases in two different indicators of depressed mood ( CES-D depressed mood subscale and POMS depression scale ) compared to RT and UC ( group by time interactions : p < 0.05 ) . 
No between group differences were observed in QOL , treatment delay , or clinically-rated toxicities . 
HT may benefit cervical cancer patients by moderating effects of chemoradiation on depressed mood and cellular immunity . 
Effects of HT on toxicities , treatment delay , QOL , and fatigue were not observed . 
Long-term clinical implications of findings are not known . 
Exercise improves physical functioning and symptom management during breast cancer chemotherapy , but the effects of different doses and types of exercise are unknown . 
A multicenter trial in Canada randomized 301 breast cancer patients to thrice-weekly supervised exercise during chemotherapy consisting of either a standard dose of 25 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise ( STAN ; n = 96 ) , a higher dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise ( HIGH ; n = 101 ) , or a combined dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic and resistance exercise ( COMB ; n = 104 ) . 
The primary endpoint was physical functioning assessed by the Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form ( SF ) -36 . 
Secondary endpoints were other physical functioning scales , symptoms , fitness , and chemotherapy completion . 
All statistical tests were linear mixed model analyses , and the P values were two-sided . 
Follow-up assessment of patient-reported outcomes was 99.0 % . 
Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses showed that neither HIGH ( +0.8 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = -0.8 to 2.4 ; P = .30 ) nor COMB ( +0.5 ; 95 % CI = -1.1 to 2.1 ; P = .52 ] were superior to STAN for the primary outcome . 
In secondary analyses not adjusted for multiple comparisons , HIGH was superior to STAN for the SF-36 physical component summary ( P = .04 ) , SF-36 bodily pain ( P = .02 ) , and endocrine symptoms ( P = .02 ) . 
COMB was superior to STAN for endocrine symptoms ( P = .009 ) and superior to STAN ( P < .001 ) and HIGH ( P < .001 ) for muscular strength . 
HIGH was superior to COMB for the SF-36 bodily pain ( P = .04 ) and aerobic fitness ( P = .03 ) . 
No differences emerged for body composition or chemotherapy completion . 
A higher volume of aerobic or combined exercise is achievable and safe during breast cancer chemotherapy and may manage declines in physical functioning and worsening symptoms better than standard volumes . 
For several decades , both preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy and preoperative irradiation have been accepted treatments for patients with tumors of the head and neck . 
Unfortunately , arguments have often been put forward in favor of one or other of the two methods , but without the performance of an objective , randomized investigation . 
To resolve this situation , the authors have carried out a multicenter , randomized prospective study of selected patients with a view to deciding which method affords better results in complex tumor therapy from the aspects of survival and postoperative quality of life . 
One hundred thirty-one patients with operable sublingual or lingual squamous cell carcinoma in stages T2NXM0 to T4MXM0 were randomized into 2 groups : 1 group participated in preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and epirubicin ( total doses : 200 mg cisplatin , 120 mg epirubicin ) via the external carotid artery , whereas the other group received preoperative radiation therapy ( 46 grays ) . 
Following subsequent radical surgery , the patients received regular follow-up for 5 years . 
By the end of the 5 years , 95 of the 131 patients had conformed to the protocol . 
Of those 95 , 47 had received preoperative chemotherapy and 48 preoperative irradiation . 
After 5 years , 18 of the 47 patients who received chemotherapy and 15 of the 48 patients who received irradiation were still alive and tumor free . 
A few more patients had died of recurrence or regional metastasis in the chemotherapy group ( 23 patients ) than in the irradiation group ( 20 patients ) . 
Occurrence of a second carcinoma was 3 times as frequent in the irradiation group ( 9 patients ) as in the chemotherapy group ( 3 patients ) . 
Overall , the survival rates were by-and-large the same for the two groups . 
Regarding postoperative quality of life , the chemotherapy group presented a more favorable picture . 
The long term survival results subsequent to preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy or preoperative radiotherapy were practically the same . 
Regarding postoperative quality of life , patients who underwent intra-arterial chemotherapy appeared to be in a slightly more favorable situation . 
The authors consider it important to stress these findings , as they are not aware of a similar randomized study of patients with tumors of the oral cavity . 
To investigate the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) on appetite , weight , and quality of life ( QL ) in patients with advanced-stage , incurable , non-hormone-sensitive cancer . 
Two hundred six eligible patients were randomized between double-blind MPA 500 mg twice daily or placebo . 
Appetite ( 0 to 10 numerical rating scale ) , weight , and QL ( European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [ EORTC-QLQ-C30 ] ) were assessed before the start of treatment ( t = 0 ) , and 6 weeks ( t = 6 ) and 12 weeks ( t = 12 ) thereafter . 
One hundred thirty-four patients ( 68 MPA and 66 placebo ) were assessable at t = 6 and 99 patients ( 53 MPA and 46 placebo ) at t = 12 . 
A beneficial effect of MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks ( P = .008 ) and 12 weeks ( P = .01 ) of treatment . 
After 12 weeks , a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen in the MPA , versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo group . 
This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant ( P = .04 ) . 
During the study , several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients . 
With the exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in nausea and vomiting , no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be demonstrated . 
The side effects profile of MPA was favorable : only a trend toward an increase in ( usually mild ) peripheral edema was observed . 
In weight-losing , advanced-stage non-hormone-sensitive cancer patients , MPA exhibits a mild side effects profile , has a beneficial effect on appetite , and may prevent further weight loss . 
However , general QL in the present study was not measurably influenced by MPA treatment . 
Cerebral metastasis is a common oncologic problem that occurs in 15-30 % of cancer patients ; approximately half such metastases are single . 
Previous retrospective studies and two randomized trials reported that the addition of surgical extirpation prior to radiation therapy increased survival , neurologic function , and quality of life compared with radiation alone in patients with a single brain metastasis . 
A randomized controlled trial was conducted in which patients with a single brain metastasis were allocated to undergo radiation alone or surgery plus radiation . 
Radiation consisted of 3000 centigray to the whole brain in 10 fractions . 
Forty-three patients received radiation alone and 41 patients surgery plus radiation . 
All but two of the study patients died . 
No difference in survival was detected between the groups ; the median survival for the radiation group was 6.3 months ( 95 % confidence interval , 3-11.4 ) compared with 5.6 months for the surgery plus radiation group ( 95 % confidence interval , 3.9-7.2 ) ( P = 0.24 ) . 
Most patients died within the first year ( 69.8 % in the radiation arm vs. 87.8 % in the surgery plus radiation arm ) . 
There were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality , morbidity , or causes of death . 
Extracranial metastases was an important predictor of mortality ( relative risk , 2.3 ) . 
The mean proportion of days that the Karnofsky performance status was > or = 70 % did not differ between the 2 groups . 
This trial failed to demonstrate that the addition of surgery to radiation therapy improved outcome of patients with a single brain metastasis . 
Thus , the efficacy of surgery plus radiation compared with radiation alone needs to be addressed by further clinical trials and/or a meta-analysis . 
To investigate whether uterine artery embolization ( UAE ) is a cost-effective alternative to hysterectomy for patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids , the authors performed an economic evaluation alongside the multicenter randomized EMMY ( EMbolization versus hysterectoMY ) trial . 
Between February 2002 and February 2004 , 177 patients were randomized to undergo UAE ( n = 88 ) or hysterectomy ( n = 89 ) and followed up until 24 months after initial treatment allocation . 
Conditional on the equivalence of clinical outcome , a cost minimization analysis was performed according to the intention to treat principle . 
Costs included health care costs inside and outside the hospital as well as costs related to absence from work ( societal perspective ) . 
Cumulative standardized costs were estimated as volumes multiplied with prices . 
The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to quantify differences in mean ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) costs between the strategies . 
In total , 81 patients underwent UAE and 75 underwent hysterectomy . 
In the UAE group , 19 patients ( 23 % ) underwent secondary hysterectomies . 
The mean total costs per patient in the UAE group were significantly lower than those in the hysterectomy group ( $ 11,626 vs $ 18,563 ; mean difference , - $ 6,936 [ -37 % ] , 95 % CI : - $ 9,548 , $ 4,281 ) . 
The direct medical in-hospital costs were significantly lower in the UAE group : $ 6,688 vs $ 8,313 ( mean difference , - $ 1,624 [ -20 % ] , 95 % CI : - $ 2,605 , - $ 586 ) . 
Direct medical out-of-hospital and direct nonmedical costs were low in both groups ( mean cost difference , $ 156 in favor of hysterectomy ) . 
The costs related to absence from work differed significantly between the treatment strategies in favor of UAE ( mean difference , - $ 5,453 ; 95 % CI : - $ 7,718 , - $ 3,107 ) . 
The costs of absence from work accounted for 79 % of the difference in total costs . 
The 24-month cumulative cost of UAE is lower than that of hysterectomy . 
From a societal economic perspective , UAE is the superior treatment strategy in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids . 
Prospective investigations of complete decongestive lymphatic physiotherapy ( CDPT ) , including manual lymphatic drainage ( MLD ) , have validated the efficacy of these interventions for the initial reduction of edema and long-term maintenance of limb volume in lymphedema . 
However , CDPT demands substantial time and effort from patients to maintain these benefits ; the treatments are not always well-accepted , and patients may suffer from a deterioration in quality-of-life or a time-dependent loss of initial treatment benefits . 
A new device designed for home use by the patient , the Flexitouch , has been developed to mechanically simulate MLD . 
We have undertaken a prospective , randomized , crossover study of the efficacy of the Flexitouch , when compared to massage , in the self-administered maintenance therapy of lymphedema . 
A prospective , randomized , crossover study of maintenance therapy was performed in 10 patients with unilateral breast cancer-associated lymphedema of the arm . 
Each observation phase included self-administered treatment with the Flexitouch or massage , 1 hour daily for 14 days , respectively , followed by crossover to the alternate treatment phase . 
Each treatment phase was preceded by a 1 week treatment washout , with use of garment only . 
The sequence of treatment was randomly assigned . 
The potential impact of treatment modality on quality of life was assessed with serial administration of the SF-36 . 
Statistical analysis disclosed that the order of treatment had no outcome influence , permitting 10 comparisons within each treatment group . 
Post-treatment arm volume reduced significantly after the Flexitouch , but not after self-administered massage . 
The patients ' mean weight decreased significantly with Flexitouch use , but not with massage . 
The Flexitouch device was apparently well-tolerated and accepted by patients . 
Serial SF-36 administration showed no deterioration in physical or psychosocial scores compared to baseline measurements ; there were no statistical differences in scores when the two treatment modalities were compared . 
This short-term prospective evaluation of the Flexitouch suggests that the device may provide better maintenance edema control than self-adiminstered massage in breast cancer-associated lymphedema . 
The apparent ease of use and reliability of response to the device suggest that further broad-scale testing is warranted . 
Patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer often develop anemia , which can contribute to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life ( QOL ) . 
Chemotherapy-induced anemia can be successfully treated using recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) . 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of once-weekly ( QW ) rHuEPO dosing to effect improved hemoglobin levels , decreased transfusion use , and improved functional outcomes and QOL in pediatric leukemic patients ( ALL ) receiving maintenance chemotherapy . 
This was a prospective randomized , single-center , open-label , 12-week case-control study of epoetin alfa in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) in remission receiving maintenance chemotherapy . 
Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either epoetin alfa ( rHuEPO group = 30 cases , 17 males and 13 females , age ; 6.8 +/- 2.33 years ) , or no epoetin alfa ( control group = 30 cases , 16 males and 14 females , age ; 6.76 +/- 2.28 years ) . 
Both groups were matched as regard age , sex , baseline Hb concentration , remission state , chemotherapy regimen , numbers and amount of blood transfusion , and leukemia state ( both were low and standard risk ) . 
Epoetin alfa was administered at a dose of 450 IU/kg , once weekly , subcutaneously ( s.c. ) for 12 consecutive weeks . 
Endpoints were changes in hematologic and QOL parameters . 
Among the 30 patients evaluable for hematologic response , the mean increase in Hb from baseline to time of final evaluation was 3.08 +/- 1.48 g/dl ( p < 0.001 ) . 
An increase in Hb of > or = 2 g/dl , in the absence of blood transfusion , occurred in 70 % of patients ( 21 of 30 patients ) who were on the study for > or = 30 days . 
The overall response rate ( Hb increase > or = 2 g/dl or Hb > or = 12 g/dl in the absence of blood transfusion ) was 90 % ( 27 of 30 patients ) . 
In 30 patients who were evaluable for QOL assessment , epoetin-alpha therapy was found to significantly ( p < 0.001 ) improve mean cancer linear analog scale ( CLAS ) scores for energy level , ability to perform daily activity , and overall QOL from baseline to the time of final evaluation . 
QW epoetin-alpha was found to be well tolerated . 
Treatment with QW epoetin-alpha was found to increase Hb levels , decrease transfusion requirement , and improve functional status and QOL in anemic patients with ALL in maintenance receiving chemotherapy . 
The once-weekly schedule is convenient , safe , and may reduce the burden on patients , parents , and their caregivers by reducing the number of visits to the clinic . 
Quality of life is an important outcome measure in the care of patients with cancer . 
We developed a new scoring system specifically for the evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction . 
This study was undertaken to evaluate the scoring system 's validity in comparing outcomes after gastric resection . 
Patients with gastric cancer , 3 months to 3 years postoperatively , were surveyed using the survey instrument . 
Postoperative dysfunction scores and the status of resuming activities of daily living were compared with the surgical procedure performed by analysis of variance and multiple-comparison techniques . 
Of 211 patients surveyed , 165 ( 119 men , 46 women ; mean age , 65.1 ± 10.5 years ) responded . 
Procedures included distal gastrectomy in 100 , total gastrectomy in 57 , and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 8 . 
The overall dysfunction score was 61.8 ± 15.5 . 
The dysfunction score was 58.9 ± 15.0 after distal gastrectomy , 66.8 ± 14.1 after total gastrectomy , and 62.4 ± 21.6 after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy . 
These values differed significantly among the groups ( P = .007 ) . 
Dysfunction scores according to postoperative activity status were 49.1 ± 15.6 in 71 patients who resumed their activities , 56.9 ± 15.7 in 39 patients with reduced activities , 57.3 ± 8.8 in 15 patients with minimal activities , and 63.3 ± 11.8 ( P < .05 ) in 16 patients who did not resume activities because of poor physical condition . 
This scoring system for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction provides an objective measure of dysfunction related to specific surgical procedures and correlates with activities of daily living in the postoperative period . 
Analgesia and early quality of recovery may be improved by epidural analgesia . 
We aimed to assess the effect of receiving epidural analgesia on surgical adverse events and quality of life after laparotomy for endometrial cancer . 
Patients were enrolled in an international , multicentre , prospective randomised trial of outcomes for laparoscopic versus open surgical treatment for the management of apparent stage I endometrial cancer ( LACE trial ) . 
The current analysis focussed on patients who received an open abdominal hysterectomy via vertical midline incision only ( n=257 ) , examining outcomes in patients who did ( n=108 ) and did not ( n=149 ) receive epidural analgesia . 
Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with or without epidural analgesia . 
More patients without epidural ( 34 % ) ceased opioid analgesia 3-5 days after surgery compared to patients who had an epidural ( 7 % ; p < 0.01 ) . 
Postoperative complications ( any grade ) occurred in 86 % of patients with and in 66 % of patients without an epidural ( p < 0.01 ) but there was no difference in serious adverse events ( p=0.19 ) . 
Epidural analgesia was associated with increased length of stay ( up to 48 days compared to up to 34 days in the non-epidural group ) . 
There was no difference in postoperative quality of life up to six months after surgery . 
Epidural analgesia was associated with an increase in any , but not serious , postoperative complications and length of stay after abdominal hysterectomy . 
Randomised controlled trials are needed to examine the effect of epidural analgesia on surgical adverse events , especially as the present data do not support a quality of life benefit with epidural analgesia . 
Cancer-related fatigue is the most disabling symptom experienced by breast cancer patients following the cancer treatment . 
The positive effects of physical activity in the rehabilitation of breast cancer patients are documented in several studies . 
In a randomized controlled study the effects of a structured physical training program on fatigue and health-related quality of life were evaluated . 
63 breast cancer patients with cancer-related chronic fatigue were randomized at the beginning of the inpatient rehabilitation . 
The control group received the standard complex rehabilitation program , the intervention group a structured physical training program and additional muscle strength and aerobic exercises . 
The effects of the treatment were evaluated by questionnaires at the start of rehabilitation ( t1 ) , end of rehabilitation ( t2 ) , and 3 months after t2 ( t3 ) . 
Isometric muscle strength and aerobic capacity were evaluated at t1 and t2 . 
There was an improvement of muscle strength at the end of rehabilitation for both groups . 
The increase from t1 to t2 was significantly higher for the training group . 
The scores for global quality of life , physical well-being , and functionality increased from t1 to t2 , but further improvement in the follow-up ( t3 ) was only observed in the training group . 
The cancer-related fatigue was significantly reduced in the training group from t1 to t3 , however , not in the control group . 
Structured physical training programs initiated during inpatient rehabilitation and continuously practiced in the time thereafter can improve symptoms of chronic fatigue and quality of life in breast cancer patients . 
The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery . 
Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease ( pT3/4 or pN+ ) . 
In recent years , encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported . 
This prospective randomized phase-III trial ( CAO/ARO/AIO-94 ) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy . 
We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity . 
Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer ( uT3/4 or uN+ , Mason CS III/IV ) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy : A total dose of 50.4 Gy ( single dose 1.8 Gy ) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes . 
5-FU ( 1,000 mg/m2/d ) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion . 
Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy ( 500 mg/m2/d , i.v . 
bolus ) were applied . 
Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting . 
Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms . 
Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision . 
In addition , stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for . 
Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival , local and distant control , secondary endpoints include rate of curative ( R0 ) resections and sphincter saving procedures , toxicity of radiochemotherapy , surgical complications and quality of life . 
As of 15th November 2000 , 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions : 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy , 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy . 
Acute toxicity ( WHO ) of radiochemotherapy was low , with less than 15 % of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity : The principal toxicity was diarrhea , with 12 % in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10 % in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3 , and 1 % in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea . 
Erythema , nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities , with less than 3 % of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea . 
Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms , with 12 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 13 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) of patients , respectively , suffering from anastomotic leakage , 4 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 3 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from postoperative bleeding , and 6 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 5 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from delayed wound healing . 
The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory , neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity . 
In a phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of axitinib versus sorafenib as second-line treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma , patients given axitinib had a longer progression-free survival ( PFS ) . 
Here , we report overall survival and updated efficacy , quality of life , and safety results . 
Eligible patients had clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma , progressive disease after one approved systemic treatment , and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS ) of 0-1 . 
723 patients were stratified by ECOG PS and previous treatment and randomly allocated ( 1:1 ) to receive axitinib ( 5 mg twice daily ; n=361 ) or sorafenib ( 400 mg twice daily ; n=362 ) . 
The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by a masked , independent radiology review committee . 
We assessed patient-reported outcomes using validated questionnaires . 
Baseline characteristics and development of hypertension on treatment were studied as prognostic factors . 
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population , and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug . 
Median overall survival was 20.1 months ( 95 % CI 16.7-23.4 ) with axitinib and 19.2 months ( 17.5-22.3 ) with sorafenib ( hazard ratio [ HR ] 0.969 , 95 % CI 0.800-1.174 ; one-sided p=0.3744 ) . 
Median investigator-assessed PFS was 8.3 months ( 95 % CI 6.7-9.2 ) with axitinib and 5·7 months ( 4.7-6.5 ) with sorafenib ( HR 0.656 , 95 % CI 0.552-0.779 ; one-sided p < 0.0001 ) . 
Patient-reported outcomes scores were similar in the treatment groups at baseline , were maintained during treatment , but decreased at end-of-treatment . 
Common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events were hypertension ( 60 [ 17 % ] ) , diarrhoea ( 40 [ 11 % ] ) , and fatigue ( 37 [ 10 % ] ) in 359 axitinib-treated patients and hand-foot syndrome ( 61 [ 17 % ] ) , hypertension ( 43 [ 12 % ] ) , and diarrhoea ( 27 [ 8 % ] ) in 355 sorafenib-treated patients . 
In a post-hoc 12-week landmark analysis , median overall survival was longer in patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or greater than in those with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg : 20.7 months ( 95 % CI 18.4-24.6 ) versus 12.9 months ( 10.1-20.4 ) in the axitinib group ( p=0.0116 ) , and 20.2 months ( 17.1-32.0 ) versus 14.8 months ( 12.0-17.7 ) in the sorafenib group ( one-sided p=0.0020 ) . 
Although overall survival , a secondary endpoint for the study , did not differ between the two groups , investigator-assessed PFS remained longer in the axitinib group compared with the sorafenib group . 
These results establish axitinib as a second-line treatment option for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma . 
Imatinib ( Gleevec ) , a highly effective specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , demonstrates a better side effect profile than interferon-alpha ( IFN ) , which impairs patients ' quality of life ( QoL ) . 
This phase III international study evaluated QoL outcomes in 1,106 newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) who were randomized to receive either imatinib 400 mg daily or IFN up to 5 MU/m ( 2 ) /d with cytarabine ( Ara-C ) 20 mg/m ( 2 ) /d added for 10 days every month ( IFN + LDAC ) . 
Crossover to the other treatment arm was permitted due to a lack of efficacy or treatment intolerance . 
QoL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Biologic Response Modifiers ( FACT-BRM ) at baseline , monthly for 6 months and then at months 9 , 12 , and 18 . 
The Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ; a composite endpoint of physical/functional/treatment-specific subscales ) was the primary endpoint . 
Secondary endpoints measured were social/family well-being ( SFWB ) and emotional well-being ( EWB ) . 
QoL was analyzed for the first 18 months of treatment using mixed effects growth curve models . 
The primary analyses were intention-to-treat ( ITT ) ; secondary analyses incorporated crossover as a time-dependent covariate . 
A total of 1,049 patients completed at least one QoL assessment . 
Two hundred sixty-one patients ( 50 % ) crossed over from IFN to imatinib and 11 ( 2 % ) crossed over from imatinib to IFN . 
There was a significant decline in TOI scores for the IFN treatment arm compared with preservation of baseline TOI scores in the imatinib arm ( P < .001 , ITT ) . 
Mean social/family and EWB scores were 22.8 and 19.5 , respectively , for imatinib and 21.6 and 17.6 , respectively , for IFN ( P < .001 , ITT ) . 
After crossing over from IFN to imatinib , patients experienced a significant ( P < .001 ) increase in TOI scores . 
Imatinib offers clear QoL advantages over IFN as first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML . 
In addition , patients who crossed over to imatinib reported higher QoL than those who remained on IFN . 
The management of recurrent ovarian cancer remains controversial . 
Single-agent topotecan is an established treatment option , and preliminary evidence suggests improved tumor control by combining topotecan with etoposide or gemcitabine . 
Women with relapsed ovarian cancer after primary surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to topotecan monotherapy 1.25 mg/m ( 2 ) /d , topotecan 1.0 mg/m ( 2 ) plus oral etoposide 50 mg/d , or topotecan 0.5 mg/m ( 2 ) /d plus gemcitabine 800 mg/m ( 2 ) on day 1 and 600 mg/m ( 2 ) on day 8 every 3 weeks . 
Patients were stratified for platinum-refractory and platinum-sensitive disease according to a recurrence-free interval of less or more than 12 months , respectively . 
The primary end point was overall survival . 
Secondary end points included progression-free survival , objective response rates , toxicity , and quality of life ( as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [ EORTC ] 30-item Quality-of-Life Questionnaire ) . 
The trial enrolled 502 patients with a mean age of 60.5 years ( +/- 10.2 years ) , 208 of whom were platinum resistant . 
Median overall survival was 17.2 months ( 95 % CI , 13.5 to 21.9 months ) with topotecan , 17.8 months ( 95 % CI , 13.7 to 20.0 months ) with topotecan plus etoposide ( log-rank P = .7647 ) , and 15.2 months ( 95 % CI , 11.3 to 20.9 months ) with topotecan plus gemcitabine ( log-rank P = .2344 ) . 
Platinum-sensitive patients lived significantly longer than platinum-refractory patients ( 21.9 v 10.6 months ) . 
The median progression-free survival was 7.0 , 7.8 , and 6.3 months , respectively . 
Objective response rates were 27.8 % , 36.1 % , and 31.6 % , respectively . 
Patients under combined treatment were at higher risk of severe thrombocytopenia . 
Nonplatinum topotecan combinations do not provide a survival advantage over topotecan alone in women with relapsed ovarian cancer . 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) can be associated with painful , pruritic , disfiguring lesions . 
As part of a multicenter , randomized phase III trial in patients with heavily pretreated advanced and/or recurrent CTCL , the effects of an interleukin-2 receptor-targeted fusion protein , denileukin diftitox ( DAB389IL-2 , ONTAK ) , on patient-rated overall quality of life ( QOL ) , skin appearance , and pruritus severity were evaluated . 
A total of 71 patients with stage IB-IVA CTCL received intravenous denileukin diftitox 9 microg/kg/day or 18 microg/kg/day over 15-60 minutes for 5 consecutive days on an outpatient basis ; cycles were planned for every 21 days for a total of 8 cycles over 6 months . 
Prior to each treatment cycle , patients were evaluated for disease response and were asked to self-rate their overall QOL via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) questionnaire , skin appearance ( 7-point scale ) , and pruritus severity ( 10-cm visual analogue scale ) . 
Composite FACT-G and most individual subscale scores ( physical , social/family , emotional , and functional well being ) in documented responders ( n = 21 ) gradually increased during the study period , generally reaching statistical significance ( P < 0.05 ) by cycle 3 , and were significantly ( P < or = 0.041 ) higher than the scores of nonresponders at endpoint . 
Additionally for responders , assessments of skin severity and pruritus severity showed significant ( P < or = 0.05 ) improvements at study endpoint compared with baseline . 
Adverse transfusion-related events ( eg , hypersensitivity reactions , flu-like syndrome ) were common during cycles 1 and 2 , and vascular-leak syndrome occurred in 25 % of patients . 
Denileukin diftitox was not associated with any clinically significant myelosuppression . 
Heavily pretreated patients with advanced and/or recurrent CTCL who responded to denileukin diftitox therapy showed significant improvements in self-rated overall QOL , skin appearance , and pruritus severity . 
Recombinant human erythropoietin ( r-HuEPO ) corrects cancer-related anemia and , thereby , improves quality of life . 
The purpose of the present study was to measure the impact of erythropoietin on hemoglobin and mood state in patients with metastatic breast cancer and mild anemia ( Hgb < 12.0 g/dL ) . 
Women were randomized to receive usual care ( G1 ) or usual care plus r-HuEPO ( G2 ) . 
Usual care included transfusions as necessary and fatigue education . 
R-HuEPO was begun at 40,000U subcutaneously per week . 
At 4 weeks , the dose was increased to 60,000U if Hgb had not increased > or = 1.0 g/dL . 
The drug was discontinued at 8 weeks if hemoglobin improvement was < 1.0 g/dL . 
The study was terminated early ( n = 27 , G1 = 13 , G2 = 14 ) when 4/14 ( 28.5 % ) subjects in G2 developed thrombotic events ( deep vein thrombosis [ DVT ] in 1 ; DVT plus pulmonary embolism [ PE ] in 1 ; DVT plus PE 1 month after drug discontinuation in 1 ; and brachial vein thrombosis with infected Mediport in 1 ) . 
In all four patients , Hgb levels were normal at the time of the event . 
No patient in G1 developed a thrombotic event . 
There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics or current chemotherapy regimen in G1 vs. G2 . 
The decision to terminate the trial was made after considerable deliberation . 
The increased incidence of thrombotic events in the r-HuEPO ( G2 ) arm of this study exceeds that in prior studies in this population and prior r-HuEPO trials . 
This may relate to the administration of r-HuEPO in this high-risk population , but the small sample size and possible predisposing risk factors preclude definitive conclusions . 
Shoulder pain and disability are well recognized complications associated with surgery for head and neck cancer . 
This study was designed to examine the effects of progressive resistance exercise training ( PRET ) on upper extremity pain and dysfunction in postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors . 
Fifty-two head and neck cancer survivors were assigned randomly to PRET ( n = 27 ) or a standardized therapeutic exercise protocol ( TP ) ( n = 25 ) for 12 weeks . 
The primary endpoint was change in patient-rated shoulder pain and disability from baseline to postintervention . 
Secondary endpoints were upper extremity strength and endurance , range of motion , fatigue , and quality of life . 
Follow-up assessment for the primary outcome was 92 % , and adherence to the supervised PRET and TP programs were 95 % and 87 % , respectively . 
On the basis of intention-to-treat analyses , PRET was superior to TP for improving shoulder pain and disability ( -9.6 ; 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] , -16.4 to -4.5 ; P = .001 ) , upper extremity strength ( +10.8 kg ; 95 % CI , 5.4-16.2 kg ; P < .001 ) , and upper extremity endurance ( +194 repetitions x kg ; 95 % CI , 10-378 repetitions x kg ; P = .039 ) . 
Changes in neck dissection impairment , fatigue , and quality of life favored the PRET group but did not reach statistical significance . 
The PRET program significantly reduced shoulder pain and disability and improved upper extremity muscular strength and endurance in head and neck cancer survivors who had shoulder dysfunction because of spinal accessory nerve damage . 
Clinicians should consider the addition of PRET in the rehabilitation of postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors . 
To examine the impact of advanced practice nurse ( APN ) -administered low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) as both a stand-alone and complementary treatment for arm volume , symptoms , and quality of life ( QOL ) in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema . 
A three-group , pilot , randomized clinical trial . 
A private rehabilitation practice in the southeastern United States . 
46 breast cancer survivors with treatment-related lymphedema . 
Patients were screened for eligibility and then randomized to either manual lymphatic drainage ( MLD ) for 40 minutes , LLLT for 20 minutes , or 20 minutes of MLD followed by 20 minutes of LLLT . 
Compression bandaging was applied after each treatment . 
Data were collected pretreatment , daily , weekly , and at the end of treatment . 
Independent variables consisted of three types of APN-administered lymphedema treatment . 
Outcome variables included limb volume , extracellular fluid , psychological and physical symptoms , and QOL . 
No statistically significant between-group differences were found in volume reduction ; however , all groups had clinically and statistically significant reduction in volume . 
No group differences were noted in psychological and physical symptoms or QOL ; however , treatment-related improvements were noted in symptom burden within all groups . 
Skin improvement was noted in each group that received LLLT . 
LLLT with bandaging may offer a time-saving therapeutic option to conventional MLD . 
Alternatively , compression bandaging alone could account for the demonstrated volume reduction . 
APNs can effectively treat lymphedema . 
APNs in private healthcare practices can serve as valuable research collaborators . 
Lasers may provide effective , less burdensome treatment for lymphedema . 
APNs with lymphedema certification can effectively treat this patient population with the use of LLLT . 
In addition , bioelectrical impedance and tape measurements can be used to assess lymphedema . 
There are patients with stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) who are not suitable for curative radical chemoradiation therapy . 
There are patients with an isolated solitary extracranial metastasis who have improved outcomes compared with those with cranial or multiple metastases . 
Patients of good performance status receiving moderate dose radiation therapy have improved survival . 
Two regimens of moderate dose chemoradiation therapy for such patients were compared in a randomized phase II trial . 
Patients were eligible if they had stage I-IIIB NSCLC , unsuitable for curative therapy , or stage IV with a PET-detected extracranial solitary metastasis . 
Patients were randomized to the following groups-arm A : 40 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks with concurrent weekly vinorelbine 25 mg/m + cisplatin 20 mg/m or arm B : 30 Gy/15 fractions/3 weeks with concurrent weekly gemcitabine 200 mg. Primary end points were feasibility , response rates , and toxicity . 
Secondary end points were progression-free survival , overall survival , and quality of life . 
Eighty-four patients were randomized . 
Compliance was above 90 % for both arms . 
The overall response rate was 51 % in arm A and 38 % in arm B ( p = 0.147 ) . 
Grade 3/4 toxicity in both arms was acceptable . 
There was no difference in median progression-free survival between the two arms ( 5.5 versus 5.0 months , p = 0.19 ) . 
Patients in arm A had longer median survival but this did not reach statistical significance ( 13.1 versus 8.3 months , p = 0.25 ) . 
No difference in quality of life was observed . 
Arm A was chosen for a future phase II comparison with radiation therapy alone as it demonstrated a response rate greater than 50 % , and data suggested that arm A had superior survival to arm B . 
To evaluate whether 3-month administration of CDB-2914 , a selective progesterone receptor modulator , reduces leiomyoma size and symptoms . 
Premenopausal women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were randomly assigned to CDB-2914 at 10 mg ( T1 ) or 20 mg ( T2 ) daily or to placebo ( PLC ) for 3 cycles or 90-102 days if no menses occurred . 
The primary outcome was leiomyoma volume change determined by magnetic resonance imaging at study entry and within 2 weeks of hysterectomy . 
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of amenorrhea , change in hemoglobin and hematocrit , ovulation inhibition , and quality-of-life assessment . 
Twenty-two patients were allocated , and 18 completed the trial . 
Age and body mass index were similar among groups . 
Leiomyoma volume was significantly reduced with CDB-2914 administration ( PLC 6 % ; CDB-2914 -29 % ; P=.01 ) , decreasing 36 % and 21 % in the T1 and T2 groups , respectively . 
During treatment , hemoglobin was unchanged , and the median estradiol was greater than 50 pg/mL in all groups . 
CDB-2914 eliminated menstrual bleeding and inhibited ovulation ( % ovulatory cycles : CDB-2914 , 20 % ; PLC , 83 % ; P=.001 ) . 
CDB-2914 improved the concern scores of the uterine leiomyoma symptom quality-of-life subscale ( P=.04 ) . 
One CDB-2914 woman developed endometrial cystic hyperplasia without evidence of atypia . 
No serious adverse events were reported . 
Compared with PLC , CDB-2914 significantly reduced leiomyoma volume after three cycles , or 90-102 days . 
CDB-2914 treatment resulted in improvements in the concern subscale of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom Quality of Life assessment . 
In this small study , CDB-2914 was well-tolerated without serious adverse events . 
Thus , there may be a role for CDB-2914 in the treatment of leiomyomata . 
To observe the clinical effectiveness of a topical application of Xiaozheng Zhitong : Paste ( , XZP ) in alleviating the cancerous pain of patients with middle/late stage cancer By : adopting a random number table , 124 patients enrolled were randomized into the treatment group ( 64 patients ) and the control group ( 60 patients ) . 
In addition to the basic therapy [ including the three-ladder ( 3L ) analgesia ] used in both groups , topical application of XZP was given to patients in the treatment group for pain alleviation . 
The analgesic efficacy was recorded in terms of pain intensity , analgesia initiating time and sustaining time , and the optimal analgesic effect revealing time . 
Meanwhile , the quality of life ( QOL ) and adverse reactions that occurred in patients were recorded as well . 
The total effective rate in the treatment group was : 84.38 % ( 54/64 ) , and in the control group it was 88.33 % ( 53/60 ) , showing no significant difference between them ( P > 0.05 ) , but the analgesia initiating time and the optimal analgesia effect revealing time in the treatment group were significantly shorter ( both P < 0.01 ) . 
Moreover , XZP was better in improving patients ' QOL , showing more significant improvements in the treatment group than those in the control group in aspects of mental condition , walking capacity , working capacity , social acceptability , sleep and joy of living ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . 
Lower incidence of adverse reactions , such as nausea , vomiting , mouth dryness , dizziness , etc. , especially constipation , was noted in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 ) . 
Applying an external compress : of XZP showed a synergistic action with 3L analgesia for shortening the initiating time and the optimal effect revealing time , and could evidently enhance patients ' QOL with fewer adverse reactions . 
Metal stent placement and single dose brachytherapy are commonly used treatment modalities for the palliation of inoperable oesophageal carcinoma . 
We investigated generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) after these palliative treatments . 
Patients with dysphagia from inoperable oesophageal carcinoma were randomised to placement of a covered Ultraflex stent ( n = 108 ) or single dose ( 12 Gy ) brachytherapy ( n = 101 ) . 
We obtained longitudinal data on disease-specific ( dysphagia score , European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) OES-23 , visual analogue pain scale ) and generic ( EORTC Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) , Euroqol ( EQ ) -5D ) HRQoL at monthly home visits by a specially-trained research nurse . 
We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up . 
Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy , but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy . 
For generic HRQoL , there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 ( role , emotional , cognitive and social ) ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D , in particular physical and role functioning ( on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up ) . 
This decline was more pronounced in the stent group . 
Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23 , in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure , which remained almost stable during follow-up . 
Reported levels of chest or abdominal pain remained stable during follow-up in both treatment groups , general pain levels increased to a minor extent . 
The effects of single dose brachytherapy on HRQoL compared favourably to those of stent placement for the palliation of oesophageal cancer . 
Future studies on palliative care for oesophageal cancer should at least include generic HRQoL scales , since these were more responsive in measuring patients ' functioning and well-being during follow-up than disease-specific HRQoL scales . 
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 'Casodex ' monotherapy ( 150 mg daily ) for metastatic and locally advanced prostate cancer . 
A total of 1,453 patients with either confirmed metastatic disease ( M1 ) , or T3/T4 non-metastatic disease with elevated prostate-specific antigen ( M0 ) were recruited into one of two identical , multicentre , randomised studies to compare 'Casodex ' 150 mg/day with castration . 
The protocols allowed for combined analysis . 
At a median follow-up period of approximately 100 weeks for both studies , 'Casodex ' 150 mg was found to be less effective than castration in patients with metastatic disease ( M1 ) at entry ( hazard ratio of 1.30 for time to death ) with a difference in median survival of 6 weeks . 
In symptomatic M1 patients , 'Casodex ' was associated with a statistically significant improvement in subjective response ( 70 % ) compared with castration ( 58 % ) . 
Analysis of a validated quality-of-life questionnaire proved an advantage for 'Casodex ' in sexual interest and physical capacity . 
'Casodex ' had a substantially lower incidence of hot flushes compared to castration ( 6-13 % compared with 39-44 % ) and the most commonly reported adverse events were those expected for a potent antiandrogen . 
However , in patients with M0 disease at entry , the data are still immature with only 13 % of M0 patients having died . 
An initial analysis of this immature data has suggested that the results in these patients may be different to those obtained in patients with M1 disease . 
A further survival analysis in patients with M0 disease is therefore planned when the data are more mature . 
'Casodex ' 150 mg is less effective than castration in patients with M1 disease . 
However , 'Casodex ' has shown a benefit in terms of quality of life and subjective response when compared to castration and has an acceptable tolerability profile . 
Thus 'Casodex ' 150 mg monotherapy is an option for patients with M1 prostate cancer for whom surgical or medical castration is not indicated or is not acceptable . 
We compared the clinical effects and impact on quality of life ( QOL ) of patients who received a 3-month course of flutamide monotherapy before radical prostatectomy with those who received a 3-month course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist monotherapy . 
Thirty-seven patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled in this study ( 19 , flutamide ; 18 , LHRH agonist ) . 
The rates of change of serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) and testosterone levels , downsizing of prostate volume , the rate of organ confined disease , adverse effects and perioperative scores measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Prostate Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC-P ) and the Sapporo Medical University Sexual Function Questionnaire ( SMUF ) were analyzed . 
At radical prostatectomy , pathological variables were not significantly different in the two groups . 
Serum testosterone level was significantly higher ( mean 359.2 compared to 10.5 , P < 0.001 ) , complete response rate of PSA ( 13 % compared to 57 % , P = 0.028 ) and rate of downsizing of prostate volume ( mean , -17.7 % compared to -35.4 % , P = 0.038 ) were significantly lower in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group . 
After neoadjuvant hormone therapy , the scores on the sexual problem domain of EORTC-P ( P = 0.033 ) and sexual desire score of SMUF ( P = 0.021 ) were significantly higher in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group . 
At a median follow-up of 34 months after prostatectomy , biochemical failure-free survival rate in the flutamide group did not differ from that in the LHRH group . 
This study suggests that flutamide monotherapy can be an acceptable modality as an option for neoadjuvant hormone therapy . 
To compare two cisplatin based chemotherapy schedules in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . 
A total of 332 patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 either in combination with teniposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1 , 3 , and 5 ( arm A ) or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 by 3-hour infusion on day 1 ( arm B ) ; cycles were repeated every 3 weeks . 
Fifteen patients were ineligible ; patient characteristics were well balanced between the two arms : 71 % were male , 71 % had less than 5 % weight loss , 89 % had a World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status of 0 to 1 , 51 % had adenocarcinoma , and 61 % had stage IV disease . 
Hematologic toxicity was significantly more severe in arm A ( leukopenia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4 : 66 % v 19 % , 83 % v 55 % , 36 % v 2 % in arms A and B , respectively ) , which resulted in more febrile neutropenia ( 27 % v 3 % in arms A and B , respectively ) , dose reductions , and treatment delays . 
There were a total of nine toxic deaths , six due to neutropenic sepsis : five in arm A and one in arm B . 
In contrast , arthralgia/myalgia ( grade 2 or 3 , 4 % v 17 % ) , peripheral neurotoxicity ( grade 2 or 3 , 6 % v 29 % ) , and hypersensitivity reactions ( 1 % v 7 % , all grades ) were significantly more frequent in arm B . 
The frequency and severity of other toxicities were comparable between the two arms . 
Responses were one complete and 44 partial on arm A ( 28 % ) and two complete and 61 partial ( 41 % ) on arm B ( P = .018 ) . 
There was no significant difference in survival , with median and 1-year survivals 9.9 versus 9.7 months and 41 % versus 43 % , respectively in arm A and B. Progression-free survival was 4.9 and 5.4 months in arm A and B , respectively . 
Selected centers participated in a quality-of-life ( QoL ) assessment , which was performed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-C30 and LC-13 administered at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter . 
Arm B achieved a better score at week 6 for emotional , cognitive and social functioning , global health status , fatigue , and appetite loss , which was lost at 12 weeks . 
In conclusion , arm B appears superior to arm A with regard to response rate , side effects , and QoL . 
Although survival was not improved , arm B offers a better palliation for advanced NSCLC patients than arm A . 
To evaluate if raising baseline and maintaining hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels with red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion could improve the outcomes of chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) . 
Patients were randomized to receive RBC transfusion to maintain their Hb levels > or=10 g/dl ( arm 1 ) or > or=12 ( arm 2 ) before the start of their 5-fluorouracil-based first-line chemotherapy . 
Objective response , KPS and quality of life ( QOL ) data were measured . 
For 87 patients enrolled , mean baseline Hb was 10.1 g/dl , and 54 patients received RBC prior to chemotherapy initiation . 
Despite transfusion , we failed to maintain the Hb level above the predefined target range . 
Eighteen patients experienced brief and reversible adverse events during transfusion , including two patients with acute pulmonary edema . 
KPS was improved from baseline to post-chemotherapy in both arms . 
QOL data showed improvement in some symptom scores , but there was no difference in the QOL scores between the two arms at baseline and all four cycles of treatment . 
Similar response rates were observed in both arms ( arm 1 , 30 % ; arm 2 , 35 % ) . 
Both arms showed similar chemotherapy duration ( 3.8 and 4.1 months , respectively ) , progression-free survival ( 4.0 and 4.1 months ) and overall survival ( 9.9 and 9.3 months ) . 
Red blood cell transfusion achieving Hb level above 10 g/dl might contribute to the improvement of the KPS and QOL seen in patients with AGC . 
The observation of equivalent outcomes at the two target Hb levels supports the feasibility of anemia correction to Hb 10 g/dl , which merits further evaluation . 
To determine whether cisplatin plus paclitaxel ( C+P ) improved response rate , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , or survival compared with cisplatin alone in patients with stage IVB , recurrent , or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix . 
PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible : patients with measurable disease , performance status ( PS ) 0 to 2 , and adequate hematologic , hepatic , and renal function received either cisplatin 50 mg/m2 or C+P ( cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 ) every 3 weeks for six cycles . 
Tumor measurements and quality-of-life ( QOL ) assessments were obtained before each treatment cycle . 
Of 280 patients entered , 6 % were ineligible . 
Among 264 eligible patients , 134 received cisplatin and 130 received C+P . 
Groups were well matched with respect to age , ethnicity , PS , tumor grade , disease site , and number of cycles received . 
The majority of all patients had prior radiation therapy ( cisplatin , 92 % ; C+P , 91 % ) . 
Objective responses occurred in 19 % ( 6 % complete plus 13 % partial ) of patients receiving cisplatin versus 36 % ( 15 % complete plus 21 % partial ) receiving C+P ( P = .002 ) . 
The median PFS was 2.8 and 4.8 months , respectively , for cisplatin versus C+P ( P < .001 ) . 
There was no difference in median survival ( 8.8 months v 9.7 months ) . 
Grade 3 to 4 anemia and neutropenia were more common in the combination arm . 
There was no significant difference in QOL scores , although a disproportionate number of patients ( cisplatin , n = 50 ; C+P , n = 33 ) dropped out of the QOL component , presumably because of increasing disease , deteriorating health status , or early death . 
C+P is superior to cisplatin alone with respect to response rate and PFS with sustained QOL . 
To investigate whether docetaxel plus platinum regimens improve survival and affect quality of life ( QoL ) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) compared with vinorelbine plus cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy . 
Patients ( n = 1,218 ) with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks ( DC ) ; docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the curve of 6 mg/mL * min every 3 weeks ( DCb ) ; or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/wk and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 4 weeks ( VC ) . 
Patients treated with DC had a median survival of 11.3 v 10.1 months for VC-treated patients ( P =.044 ; hazard ratio , 1.183 [ 97.2 % confidence interval , 0.989 to 1.416 ] ) . 
The 2-year survival rate was 21 % for DC-treated patients and 14 % for VC-treated patients . 
Overall response rate was 31.6 % for DC-treated patients v 24.5 % for VC-treated patients ( P =.029 ) . 
Median survival ( 9.4 v 9.9 months [ for VC ] ; P =.657 ; hazard ratio , 1.048 [ 97.2 confidence interval , 0.877 to 1.253 ] ) and response ( 23.9 % ) with DCb were similar to those results for VC . 
Neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , infection , and febrile neutropenia were similar with all three regimens . 
Grade 3 to 4 anemia , nausea , and vomiting were more common ( P < .01 ) with VC than with DC or DCb . 
Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had consistently improved QoL compared with VC-treated patients , who experienced deterioration in QoL . 
DC resulted in a more favorable overall response and survival rate than VC . 
Both DC and DCb were better tolerated and provided patients with consistently improved QoL compared with VC . 
These findings demonstrate that a docetaxel plus platinum combination is an effective treatment option with a favorable therapeutic index for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC . 
Tivozanib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 ( VEGFR1 ) , -2 , and -3 . 
This phase III trial compared tivozanib with sorafenib as initial targeted therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . 
Patients with metastatic RCC , with a clear cell component , prior nephrectomy , measurable disease , and 0 or 1 prior therapies for metastatic RCC were randomly assigned to tivozanib or sorafenib . 
Prior VEGF-targeted therapy and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor were not permitted . 
The primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) by independent review . 
A total of 517 patients were randomly assigned to tivozanib ( n = 260 ) or sorafenib ( n = 257 ) . 
PFS was longer with tivozanib than with sorafenib in the overall population ( median , 11.9 v 9.1 months ; hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.797 ; 95 % CI , 0.639 to 0.993 ; P = .042 ) . 
One hundred fifty-six patients ( 61 % ) who progressed on sorafenib crossed over to receive tivozanib . 
The final overall survival ( OS ) analysis showed a trend toward longer survival on the sorafenib arm than on the tivozanib arm ( median , 29.3 v 28.8 months ; HR , 1.245 ; 95 % CI , 0.954 to 1.624 ; P = .105 ) . 
Adverse events ( AEs ) more common with tivozanib than with sorafenib were hypertension ( 44 % v 34 % ) and dysphonia ( 21 % v 5 % ) . 
AEs more common with sorafenib than with tivozanib were hand-foot skin reaction ( 54 % v 14 % ) and diarrhea ( 33 % v 23 % ) . 
Tivozanib demonstrated improved PFS , but not OS , and a differentiated safety profile , compared with sorafenib , as initial targeted therapy for metastatic RCC . 
To compare the health-related quality of life in patients with narrow gastric tube and whole stomach reconstructions after oncologic esophagectomy . 
In a prospective randomized single-center study from 2007 to 2008 , 104 patients underwent esophagectomy for cancer . 
To assess health-related quality of life , the questionnaire ( European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and the Oesophagus-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire 18 ) was administered at 3 weeks , 6 months , 1 year , and 2 years after surgery . 
The perioperative complication rate was 26.9 % in narrow gastric tube group and 48.1 % in whole stomach group ( P = 0.31 ) . 
At the time of 3 weeks after surgery , the reflux and dyspnea scores were higher in whole stomach group than in narrow gastric tube group , which meant that the patients in whole stomach group suffered more severe problem . 
At the time of 6 months and 1 year after surgery , the reflux scores were lower in narrow gastric tube group than in whole stomach group , which revealed that there were less problems of reflux in the patients of narrow gastric tube group ; meanwhile , the score of physical function scale in narrow gastric tube group was higher conversely , which suggested that the patients gain a better status in physical function . 
Nausea and vomiting is the only notable symptom that was worse in whole stomach group at the time of 2 years after surgery , which suggested that patients in whole stomach group suffered more severe nausea and vomiting . 
Narrow gastric tube reconstruction may be a good alternative choice for patients undergoing oncologic esophagectomy in view of better health-related quality of life after the surgery . 
This randomised trial compared three chemotherapy regimens in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer , in terms of their effect on overall and progression-free survival ; other endpoints included toxicity , symptom palliation , and quality of life . 
905 patients were randomly assigned the de Gramont regimen ( n=303 ; folinic acid 200 mg/m ( 2 ) , fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m ( 2 ) , and infusion 600 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 and 2 , repeated every 14 days ) , the Lokich regimen ( n=301 ; protracted venous infusion of fluorouracil 300 mg/m ( 2 ) daily ) , or raltitrexed ( n=301 ; 3 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously every 21 days ) . 
Analyses were by intention to treat . 
Median follow-up of survivors was 67 weeks . 
For the de Gramont , Lokich , and raltitrexed groups , respectively , median survival was 294 , 302 , and 266 days . 
The hazard ratios for overall survival were 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.70-1.12 , p=0.17 ) for de Gramont versus Lokich , and 0.99 ( 0.79-1.25 , p=0.94 ) for de Gramont versus raltitrexed . 
An increase in treatment-related deaths was seen on raltitrexed ( de Gramont one , Lokich two , raltitrexed 18 ) due to combined gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity . 
Patients ' assessment of quality of life showed that raltitrexed was inferior to the fluorouracil-based regimens , especially in terms of palliation and functioning . 
The deGramont and Lokich regimens were similar in terms of survival , quality of life , and response rates . 
The Lokich regimen was associated with more central line complications and hand-foot syndrome . 
Raltitrexed showed similar response rates and overall survival to the de Gramont regimen and was easier to administer , but resulted in greater toxicity and inferior quality of life . 
This study aims to describe and compare health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) in patients with node-positive and high-risk node-negative HER2-positive early breast cancer receiving adjuvant docetaxel and trastuzumab-based or docetaxel-based regimens alone . 
Eligible patients ( n = 3,222 ) were randomly assigned to either four cycles of adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of docetaxel ( AC→T ) or one of two trastuzumab-containing regimens : adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab administered for 1 year ( AC→TH ) or six cycles of docetaxel plus carboplatin combined with trastuzumab administered for 1 year ( TCH ) . 
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and BR-23 were administered at baseline , the start of cycle 4 ( mid ) , and the end of chemotherapy ( EOC ) , as well as at 6 , 12 , and 24 months after chemotherapy . 
Compliance rates for the EORTC questionnaires were acceptable at 72 % -93 % of eligible patients out to the 12-month assessment . 
Systemic side effect ( SE ) change scores were significantly improved for TCH-treated patients compared with AC→TH and AC→T at EOC , suggesting improved tolerability . 
Physical functioning ( PF ) was only slightly worse at midpoint for those receiving TCH , compared with patients who were just starting on taxane in an AC→TH regimen , but was otherwise similar between arms . 
All treatment arms recovered from the deterioration in SE , PF , and Global Health Scale scores by 1 year and median future perspective change scores continued to improve throughout treatment and follow-up . 
HRQL outcomes for adjuvant docetaxel and trastuzumab-based regimens are favorable and support TCH as a more tolerable treatment option . 
Patients undergoing gastrectomy because of stomach cancer often face weight loss in the perioperational period , which can lead to malnutrition and negative treatment outcomes . 
The purpose of this study was to develop a patient participation-based dietary intervention ( PPDI ) and evaluate its effects on patient outcomes . 
This was a prospective , randomized controlled trial in which the patients were recruited in a cancer center in South Korea . 
The participants ( N = 56 ) , who underwent gastrectomy with stomach cancer stage I to III , were randomly assigned into either the experimental or the control group . 
The PPDI , which was given on the day before the hospital discharge , comprised 2 face-to-face and 2 telephone interventions . 
The outcome variables included body weight , body mass index , muscle mass , the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment , Dietary Symptom Scale , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General , Karnofsky Performance Status , Adherence to Dietary Guidelines Scale , Scale of Dietary Knowledge , Patient Satisfaction Scale , and a 3-day food diary . 
Participants in the PPDI intervention demonstrated significant ( P < .05 ) reductions in adverse dietary symptoms and significant improvements ( P < .05 ) in functional status , performance status , dietary intake , adherence to dietary guidelines , dietary knowledge , and satisfaction with the intervention as compared with the control group over time . 
The PPDI was an effective dietary intervention for patients undergoing a gastrectomy for gastric cancer and deserves additional study in other populations of patients . 
Incorporating patients ' perspectives into a dietary intervention after gastrectomy for gastric cancer may contribute to improved patient outcomes and quality care . 
Colonic pouches have been used for 20 years to provide reservoir function after reconstructive proctectomy for rectal cancer . 
More recently coloplasty has been advocated as an alternative to a colonic pouch . 
However there have been no long-term randomized , controlled trials to compare functional outcomes of coloplasty , colonic J-Pouch ( JP ) , or a straight anastomosis ( SA ) after the treatment of low rectal cancer . 
: To compare the complications , long-term functional outcome , and quality of life ( QOL ) of patients undergoing a coloplasty , JP , or an SA in reconstruction of the lower gastrointestinal tract after proctectomy for low rectal cancer . 
A multicenter study enrolled patients with low rectal cancer , who were randomized intraoperatively to coloplasty ( CP-1 ) or SA if JP was not feasible , or JP or coloplasty ( CP-2 ) if a JP was feasible . 
Patients were followed for 24 months with SF-36 surveys to evaluate the QOL . 
Bowel function was measured quantitatively and using Fecal Incontinence Severity Index ( FISI ) . 
Urinary function and sexual function were also assessed . 
Three hundred sixty-four patients were randomized . 
All patients were evaluated for complications and recurrence . 
Mean age was 60 +/-12 years , 71 % were male . 
Twenty-three ( 7.4 % ) died within 24 months of surgery . 
No significant difference was observed in the complications among the 4 groups . 
Two hundred ninety-seven of 364 were evaluated for functional outcome at 24 months . 
There was no difference in bowel function between the CP-1 and SA groups . 
JP patients had fewer bowel movements , less clustering , used fewer pads and had a lower FISI than the CP-2 group . 
Other parameters were not statistically different . 
QOL scores at 24 months were similar for each of the 4 groups . 
In patients undergoing a restorative resection for low rectal cancer , a colonic JP offers significant advantages in function over an SA or a coloplasty . 
In patients who can not have a pouch , coloplasty seems not to improve the bowel function of patients over that with an SA . 
Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery , compared with postsurgical radiation therapy alone , has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival significantly among patients with poor-prognosis ( i.e. , advanced stage disease or metastasis to regional lymph nodes ) resectable rectal cancer . 
However , the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects , raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality-of-life costs for the individual patient . 
To assess the trade-offs between improved survival and increased treatment toxicity , we reanalyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy alone in the treatment of patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer . 
The data were from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial in which 204 patients with poor-prognosis rectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy . 
A quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity ( Q-TWiST ) analysis was used to account for freedom from symptomatic disease and from early and late side effects of treatment . 
All reported P values are two-sided . 
As reported previously , the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 12 % -50 % ; P = .0016 ) and reduced the overall death rate by 29 % ( 95 % CI = 7 % -45 % ; P = .025 ) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone . 
In the 5 years following assignment to treatment , patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity ( 3.1 months ; 95 % CI = 2.0-4.1 months ) , shorter survival after relapse ( 3.6 months less ; 95 % CI = 0.9-6.3 months less ) , and more TWiST ( 6.1 months ; 95 % CI = 0.2-12.0 months ) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone . 
Despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects , the Q-TWiST analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease . 
Use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified , since the improved outcome in terms of delayed recurrence and increased survival balances the time spent with early and late toxic effects . 
The Q-TWiST method is an excellent way to compare treatment outcomes that include quality-of-life considerations . 
Malnutrition occurs frequently in patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal ( GI ) or head and neck area and can lead to negative outcomes . 
The aim of this study is to determine the impact of early and intensive nutrition intervention ( NI ) on body weight , body composition , nutritional status , global quality of life ( QoL ) and physical function compared to usual practice in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy to the GI or head and neck area . 
Outpatients commencing at least 20 fractions of radiotherapy to the GI or head and neck area were randomised to receive intensive , individualised nutrition counselling by a dietitian using a standard protocol and oral supplements if required , or the usual practice of the centre ( general advice and nutrition booklet ) . 
Outcome parameters were measured at baseline and 4 , 8 and 12 weeks after commencing radiotherapy using valid and reliable tools . 
A total of 60 patients ( 51 M : 9 F ; mean age 61.9+/-14.0 years ) were randomised to receive either NI ( n=29 ) or usual care ( UC ) ( n=31 ) . 
The NI group had statistically smaller deteriorations in weight ( P < 0.001 ) , nutritional status ( P=0.020 ) and global QoL ( P=0.009 ) compared with those receiving UC . 
Clinically , but not statistically significant differences in fat-free mass were observed between the groups ( P=0.195 ) . 
Early and intensive NI appears beneficial in terms of minimising weight loss , deterioration in nutritional status , global QoL and physical function in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy to the GI or head and neck area . 
Weight maintenance in this population leads to beneficial outcomes and suggests that this , rather than weight gain , may be a more appropriate aim of NI . 
There is a paucity of methodologically robust vocational rehabilitation ( VR ) intervention trials . 
This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a VR trial of women with breast cancer to inform the development of a larger interventional study . 
Women were recruited in Scotland and randomised to either a case management VR service or to usual care . 
Data were collected on eligibility , recruitment and attrition rates to assess trial feasibility , and interviews conducted to determine trial acceptability . 
Sick leave days ( primary outcome ) were self-reported via postal questionnaire every 4 weeks during the first 6 months post-surgery and at 12 months . 
Secondary outcome measures were change in employment pattern , quality of life and fatigue . 
Of the 1,114 women assessed for eligibility , 163 ( 15 % ) were eligible . 
The main reason for ineligibility was age ( > 65 years , n = 637 , 67 % ) . 
Of those eligible , 111 ( 68 % ) received study information , of which 23 ( 21 % ) consented to participate in the study . 
Data for 18 ( 78 % ) women were analysed ( intervention : n = 7 ; control : n = 11 ) . 
Participants in the intervention group reported , on average , 53 fewer days of sick leave over the first 6 months post-surgery than those in the control group ; however , this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.122 ; 95 % confidence interval -15.8 , 122.0 ) . 
No statistically significant differences were found for secondary outcomes . 
Interviews with trial participants indicated that trial procedures , including recruitment , randomisation and research instruments , were acceptable . 
Conducting a pragmatic trial of effectiveness of a VR intervention among cancer survivors is both feasible and acceptable , but more research about the exact components of a VR intervention and choice of outcomes to measure effectiveness is required . 
VR to assist breast cancer patients in the return to work process is an important component of cancer survivorship plans . 
Intravenous ( IV ) granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) might be safer and more convenient than subcutaneous ( SC ) administration to hospitalized hemato-oncological patients receiving chemotherapy . 
To compare IV vs. SC G-CSF administration , we conducted a randomized , open-label trial . 
We included inpatients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . 
Patients were randomized to 5 mcg/kg single daily dose of IV bolus versus SC filgrastim given for its clinical indications . 
Patients were crossed-over to the alternate study arm on the subsequent chemotherapy course . 
The primary outcomes were time from initiation of filgrastim to recovery of stable neutrophil count of > 500 cells/µL and a composite clinical outcome of infection or death assessed for the first course post-randomization . 
The study was stopped on the second interim analysis . 
Of 120 patients randomized , 118 were evaluated in the first treatment course . 
The mean time to neutropenia resolution was longer with IV G-CSF [ 7.9 days , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 6.6-9.1 ] compared with SC G-CSF ( 5.4 days , 95 % CI 4.6-6.2 ) , log-rank P = 0.001 . 
Longer neutropenia duration was observed in all patient subgroups , except for patients undergoing autologous HCT . 
There was no significant difference between groups in the occurrence of infection or death , but more deaths were observed with IV ( 4/57 , 7 % ) versus SC ( 1/61 , 1.6 % ) G-CSF administration , P = 0.196 . 
Similar results were observed when all 158 courses following cross-over were analyzed . 
Patients reported similar pain and satisfaction scores in both groups . 
Bolus IV administration of G-CSF results in longer neutropenia duration than SC administration , with no difference in clinical or quality-of-life measures . 
Fatigue has a significant impact on the quality of life ( QOL ) of cancer patients . 
Recent research has suggested that physical activity can reduce fatigue in patients receiving active cancer treatment . 
In this project , we examined the impact that participation in a randomized controlled trial of a multidisciplinary intervention designed to impact overall QOL had on fatigue for advanced cancer patients actively receiving treatment . 
Patients with newly diagnosed cancer were randomly assigned to an 8-session structured multidisciplinary intervention or a standard-care arm at the beginning of their course of radiotherapy ( RT ) designed to impact QOL . 
Ninety-minute sessions were led by either a psychiatrist or psychologist , collaborating with a nurse , physical therapist , chaplain , or social worker , depending on the session 's theme . 
The fatigue assessments used in this trial included the Linear Analogue Self Assessment ( LASA ) , the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) , Spielberger 's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , and the Symptom Distress Scale ( SDS ) . 
There were 115 participants enrolled and the 2 randomization arms were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics and treatment received except for increased commuting distance for the patients in the intervention arm ( P = 0.042 ) . 
Most of scores indicated less fatigue ( higher score ) in the standard treatment group , but there were no statistically significant differences found at baseline and weeks 4 , 8 , and 27 except for SDS at week 8 ( P = 0.018 ) with less patients reporting significant fatigue in the standard treatment arm . 
For the entire participant population , fatigue levels initially worsened with radiotherapy , stabilized at week 8 , and returned to baseline by week 27 . 
Disease site , chemotherapy use , and radiotherapy dose did not have a significant impact on fatigue levels . 
Radiotherapy initially caused a worsening of fatigue but with time fatigue levels returned to baseline . 
Clinically , this structured multidisciplinary intervention had no impact on fatigue , and there was the suggestion the multiple sessions may have contributed to worse fatigue during active cancer treatment . 
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an 8-week supervised exercise program in de-conditioned cancer survivors within 2-6 months of chemotherapy completion . 
Participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week , twice-weekly , supervised aerobic exercise training regime ( n = 23 ) or a usual care group ( n = 20 ) . 
Feasibility was assessed by recruitment rate , program adherence and participant feedback . 
The primary outcome was aerobic fitness assessed by the Modified Bruce fitness test at baseline ( 0 weeks ) , post-intervention ( 8 weeks ) and at 3-month follow-up . 
Secondary outcomes included physical activity , waist circumference , fatigue and quality of life . 
The recruitment rate was 81 % and adherence to the supervised exercise was 78.3 % . 
Meaningful differences in aerobic fitness between the exercise and usual care groups at both the 8-week [ mean 3.0 mL kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( 95 % CI -1.1-7.0 ) ] and 3-month follow-up [ 2.1 mL kg ( -1 ) min ( -1 ) ( -2.3-6.6 ) ] were found , although these differences did not achieve statistical significance ( p values > 0.14 ) . 
Self-reported physical activity increased in the exercise group ( EG ) compared to the usual care group at both 8-week ( p = 0.01 ) and 3-month follow-up ( p = 0.03 ) and significant differences in favour of the EG were found for physical well-being at both the 8-week ( p = 0.03 ) and 3-month follow-up ( p = 0.04 ) . 
Improvements in fatigue ( p = 0.01 ) , total quality of life plus fatigue ( p = 0.04 ) , and a composite physical functioning score ( p = 0.01 ) at the 3-month follow-up were also found . 
The PEACH trial suggests that 8 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training was feasible and may improve aerobic fitness , fatigue and quality of life in de-conditioned cancer survivors during the early survivorship phase . 
Exercise interventions commenced in the early survivorship phase appear safe , feasible and may lead to improvements in QOL and fatigue . 
Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) is a putative mediator of the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome . 
The current study was designed to determine whether etanercept ( a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75-kilodalton TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin [ Ig ] G1 ) could palliate this syndrome . 
A total of 63 evaluable patients were randomly assigned to receive either etanercept at a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly versus a comparably administered placebo . 
All patients had an incurable malignancy , acknowledged loss of weight and/or appetite as a concern , and reported a weight loss of > 2.27 kg over 2 months and/or a daily intake of < 20 calories/kg body weight . 
Over time , weight gain was found to be minimal in both treatment arms ; no patient gained > or=10 % of their baseline weight . 
Previously validated appetite questionnaires revealed negligible improvements in both treatment arms . 
The median survival was also comparable ( 175 days vs 148 days in etanercept-treated and placebo-exposed patients , respectively ; P = .82 ) . 
Finally , preliminary data regarding adverse events demonstrated that patients treated with etanercept had higher rates of neurotoxicity ( 29 % vs 0 % ) but lower rates of anemia ( 0 % vs 19 % ) and thrombocytopenia ( 0 % vs 14 % ) . 
Infection rates were negligible in both groups . 
Genotyping for TNF-alpha-238 and TNF-alpha-308 polymorphisms revealed no clinical significance for these genotypes , except for a preliminary association between presence of the -238 G/A genotype and relatively less favorable survival . 
Etanercept , as prescribed in the current trial , does not appear to palliate the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome in patients with advanced disease . 
Hepatic metastases derive most of their blood supply from the hepatic artery ; therefore , for patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer , hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) of chemotherapy may improve outcome . 
In a multi-institutional trial , 135 patients were randomly assigned to receive HAI versus systemic bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin . 
The primary end point was survival ; secondary end points were response , recurrence , toxicity , quality of life , cost , and the influence of molecular markers . 
Overall survival was significantly longer for HAI versus systemic treatment ( median , 24.4 v 20 months ; P = .0034 ) , as were response rates ( 47 % and 24 % ; P = .012 ) and time to hepatic progression ( THP ; 9.8 v 7.3 months ; P = .034 ) . 
Time to extrahepatic progression ( 7.7 v 14.8 months ; P = .029 ) was significantly shorter in the HAI group . 
Quality-of-life measurements showed improved physical functioning in the HAI group at the 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments . 
Toxicity included grade > or = 3 neutropenia ( 2 % and 45 % ; P < .01 ) , stomatitis ( 0 % and 24 % ; P < .01 ) , and bilirubin elevation ( 18.6 % and 0 ; P < .01 ) in the HAI and systemic treatment groups , respectively . 
A greater proportion of men versus women receiving HAI experienced biliary toxicity ( 37 % and 15 % , respectively ; P = .05 ) . 
For HAI patients with thymidylate synthase levels in tumor less than or > or = 4 , the median survival was 24 and 14 months , respectively ( P = .17 ) . 
HAI therapy increased overall survival , response rate , THP , and was associated with better physical functioning compared with systemic therapy . 
Additional studies need to address the overall benefit and cost of new chemotherapy agents versus HAI alone or the combination of HAI with new agents . 
Previous studies have demonstrated that both anastrozole and letrozole are well tolerated . 
Letrozole suppresses estrogen to a greater degree than anastrozole in the serum and breast tumor . 
Concerns have been raised that greater potency may adversely affect patients ' quality of life ( QOL ) . 
One hundred eighty-one postmenopausal women with invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole or the reverse sequence . 
One hundred and six received immediate adjuvant aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) following surgery , and 75 received extended adjuvant therapy . 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Endocrine Subscale ( FACT-B-ES ) QOL questionnaires were completed to assess QOL on each drug . 
Additional side-effect profiles were collected . 
Each patient completed a patient preference form . 
Twenty-one patients withdrew before study end , 10/179 ( 5.6 % ) while taking letrozole and 4/173 ( 2.3 % ) while taking anastrozole ( P = 0.12 ) . 
Tamoxifen-naïve patients had a higher mean ES ( endocrine symptoms subscale ) score at entry versus those having extended therapy ( 66.0 vs. 61.9 ; P = 0.001 ) . 
There was no significant change in FACT-B-ES ( overall ) scores or ES scores while patients were taking anastrozole or letrozole and no significant differences between drugs . 
Nearly 80 % of patients reported one or more side effects with either agent . 
No differences in frequency , grade , or range of side effects were seen between drugs . 
Of 160 patients , 49 ( 30.6 % ) preferred letrozole , 57 ( 35.6 % ) preferred anastrozole , and 54 ( 33.8 % ) had no preference ( P = 0.26 , Pearson 's Chi-squared test ) . 
In conclusion , both AIs are equally well tolerated . 
There were no significant differences in QOL scores between the two drugs . 
Patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life ( QoL ) benefits were investigated in a randomized , phase III trial of afatinib or cisplatin/pemetrexed . 
Three hundred forty-five patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned 2:1 to afatinib 40 mg per day or up to six cycles of cisplatin/pemetrexed . 
Lung cancer symptoms and health-related QoL were assessed every 21 days until progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and Lung Cancer-13 questionnaires . 
Analyses of cough , dyspnea , and pain were preplanned , including percentage of patients who improved on therapy , time to deterioration of symptoms , and change in symptoms over time . 
Questionnaire compliance was high . 
Compared with chemotherapy , afatinib significantly delayed the time to deterioration for cough ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , 0.60 ; 95 % CI , 0.41 to 0.87 ; P = .007 ) and dyspnea ( HR , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.50 to 0.93 ; P = .015 ) , but not pain ( HR , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.62 to 1.10 ; P = .19 ) . 
More patients on afatinib ( 64 % ) versus chemotherapy ( 50 % ) experienced improvements in dyspnea scores ( P = .010 ) . 
Differences in mean scores over time significantly favored afatinib over chemotherapy for cough ( P < .001 ) and dyspnea ( P < .001 ) . 
Afatinib showed significantly better mean scores over time in global health status/QoL ( P = .015 ) and physical ( P < .001 ) , role ( P = .004 ) , and cognitive ( P = .007 ) functioning compared with chemotherapy . 
Fatigue and nausea were worse with chemotherapy , whereas diarrhea , dysphagia , and sore mouth were worse with afatinib ( all P < .01 ) . 
In patients with lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations , first-line afatinib was associated with better control of cough and dyspnea compared with chemotherapy , although diarrhea , dysphagia , and sore mouth were worse . 
Global health status/QoL was also improved over time with afatinib compared with chemotherapy . 
The aim of this study was to compare the effects on health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) of two treatment regimens in the TEX trial during 9 month from random assignment , with emphasis on the 2- and 9-months assessments . 
A total of 287 patients were randomized to treatment in 3-week cycles with either epirubicin plus paclitaxel ( ET , 143 patients ) , or epirubicin , paclitaxel and capecitabine ( TEX , 144 patients ) . 
HRQOL was assessed by the EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaires at five points during 9 months . 
A total of 252 ( 88 % ) completed questionnaires before randomization . 
Response rate for the following assessments was > 75 % . 
There were no statistically significant differences between the TEX group and the ET group on any of the subscales 2 months after randomization . 
Small clinical differences ( 5-10 points ) in favor of the ET group were found for global quality of life , role functioning , social functioning , and insomnia . 
At the 9-months assessment , the TEX group scored statistically significantly higher on global quality of life and physical functioning . 
Small clinically significant differences were found for global quality of life , physical functioning , role functioning , emotional functioning , dyspnoea , and insomnia , all in favour of the TEX group . 
At the 2-months assessment , when side-effects of chemotherapy were present , patients in the TEX group appeared to fare a bit worse than those receiving ET . 
However , after 9 months , when the patients had adapted to treatment , the TEX group seemed to have a slightly better quality of life . 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG ) compared to open distal gastrectomy ( ODG ) in the treatment of early gastric cancer with respect to survival , surgical outcomes , complications , and quality of life ( QOL ) . 
One hundred sixty-four patients with cT1N0M0 and cT1N1M0 distal gastric cancer were randomly assigned to either the LADG group or the ODG group . 
The primary end point was the 5-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) rate . 
Complications were classified using the accordion severity classification of postoperative complications scheme . 
QOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 preoperatively and postoperatively during regular follow-up visits . 
This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov . 
The median ( range ) follow-up period was 74.3 ( 24.8-90.8 ) months . 
The LADG and ODG groups showed similar survival [ 5-year DFS rate : 98.8 % vs. 97.6 % , respectively ( P = 0.514 ) , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) rate : 97.6 vs. 96.3 % , respectively ( P = 0.721 ) ] or overall complication rate ( 29.3 vs. 42.7 % , respectively ; P = 0.073 ) . 
Mild complications were significantly less frequent in the LADG group than in the ODG group ( 23.2 vs. 41.5 % ; P = 0.012 ) . 
The rates of moderate , severe , and long-term complications ( i.e. , 31 days to 5 years after surgery ) did not differ significantly between groups . 
No clinically meaningful differences were detected between the two groups in long-term QOL . 
LADG showed similar DFS and OS compared to ODG in treating early gastric cancer . 
Marginal benefits in mild complications were observed with LADG . 
LADG did not show advantages over ODG regarding other complications and long-term QOL . 
To evaluate the efficacy and economic efficiency of a multimedia , multimodal physical activity program for women undergoing adjuvant therapy following surgery for breast cancer . 
We conducted a randomized trial with concurrent incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and blinded baseline , 3 , 6 and 12-month follow-up assessments amongst women undergoing adjuvant therapy following surgery for breast cancer ( n = 89 ) . 
The intervention was a multimedia , multimodal exercise program comprising strength , balance and endurance training elements . 
The control was sham flexibility and relaxation program delivered using similar materials . 
The primary outcome was health-related quality of life ( EQ-5D & amp ; VAS , EORTC C30 , BR23 ) . 
Economic outcomes included direct health care costs and productivity gains and losses . 
Participants in the intervention group demonstrated greater improvement in health-related quality of life between baseline and the 3-month assessment [ mean ( sd ) EQ-5D VAS ( 0-100 ) baseline : 72.6 ( 15.6 ) , 3 month : 80.6 ( 11.6 ) ] when compared to control group participants [ baseline : 77.5 ( 13.5 ) , 3 month : 74.1 ( 20.6 ) , P = 0.006 ] and also improved more in terms of physical function [ mean ( sd ) EORTC C30 physical function scale intervention ( 0-100 ) baseline : 84.9 ( 14.8 ) , 3 month : 86.9 ( 10.7 ) , control baseline : 91.3 ( 9.6 ) , 3 month : 86.7 ( 14.9 ) , P = 0.02 ] . 
These improvements were not sustained beyond this point . 
Upper limb volumes were also lower amongst intervention group participants . 
However , there was low probability that the intervention would be both less costly and more effective than the control condition ( range probability = 0.05-50.02 % depending on approach ) . 
Provision of multimodal exercise programs will improve the short-term health of women undergoing adjuvant therapy for breast cancer but are of questionable economic efficiency . 
Somatostatin analogs act directly on breast cancer cells and indirectly on insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) levels . 
This trial was undertaken to assess whether octreotide would lower insulin and IGF-1 levels and reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence . 
The NCIC CTG MA.14 ( NCIC Clinical Trials Group MA.14 ) trial randomly assigned postmenopausal women to 5 years of tamoxifen 20 mg daily ( TAM ) or TAM plus 2 years of octreotide 90 mg depot intramuscular injections monthly ( TAM-OCT ) as adjuvant therapy . 
The primary end point was event-free survival ( EFS ) . 
Secondary end points were relapse-free survival ( RFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , toxicity , and effects of treatment on IGF physiology . 
Among 667 women with a median follow-up of 7.9 years , 220 events occurred-108 with TAM-OCT and 112 with TAM . 
Adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs ; TAM-OCT to TAM ) were 0.93 for EFS ( 95 % CI , 0.71 to 1.22 ; P = .62 ) , 0.84 for RFS ( 95 % CI , 0.59 to 1.18 ; P = .31 ) , and 0.97 for OS ( 95 % CI , 0.69 to 1.37 ; P = .86 ) . 
Among patients with normal baseline gallbladder imaging , cholecystectomy was required in 23.0 % of those receiving TAM-OCT but in only 1.4 % of those receiving TAM ( P < .001 ) . 
At 4 months , TAM-OCT had significantly ( P < .001 ) lowered IGF-1 , IGF binding protein 3 , and C-peptide levels . 
Older age ( P = .02 ) , tumor size ( P = .001 ) , nodal status ( P = .01 ) , high C-peptide levels ( P < .001 ) , and higher body mass index ( BMI ) in models excluding C-peptide ( P < .001 ) were associated with poorer EFS in multivariate analysis . 
Octreotide-related changes in circulating IGF-1 and C-peptide levels were statistically significant . 
Octreotide did not add significant clinical benefit . 
High C-peptide levels ( surrogate for insulin secretion rate ) and high BMI were associated with poor outcome . 
There are few reports about the course of vestibular schwannoma ( VS ) patients following gamma knife radiosurgery ( GKRS ) compared with the course following conservative management ( CM ) . 
In this study , we present prospectively collected data of 237 patients with unilateral VS extending outside the internal acoustic canal who received either GKRS ( 113 ) or CM ( 124 ) . 
The aim was to measure the effect of GKRS compared with the natural course on tumor growth rate and hearing loss . 
Secondary end points were postinclusion additional treatment , quality of life ( QoL ) , and symptom development . 
The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging scans , clinical examination , and QoL assessment by SF-36 questionnaire . 
Statistics were performed by using Spearman correlation coefficient , Kaplan-Meier plot , Poisson regression model , mixed linear regression models , and mixed logistic regression models . 
Mean follow-up time was 55.0 months ( 26.1 standard deviation , range 10-132 ) . 
Thirteen patients were lost to follow-up . 
Serviceable hearing was lost in 54 of 71 ( 76 % ) ( CM ) and 34 of 53 ( 64 % ) ( GKRS ) patients during the study period ( not significant , log-rank test ) . 
There was a significant reduction in tumor volume over time in the GKRS group . 
The need for treatment following initial GKRS or CM differed at highly significant levels ( log-rank test , P < .001 ) . 
Symptom and QoL development did not differ significantly between the groups . 
In VS patients , GKRS reduces the tumor growth rate and thereby the incidence rate of new treatment about tenfold . 
Hearing is lost at similar rates in both groups . 
Symptoms and QoL seem not to be significantly affected by GKRS . 
The AGO-ETC trial compared 5-year relapse-free survival of intense dose-dense ( IDD ) sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin ( E ) , paclitaxel ( T ) , and cyclophosphamide ( C ) ( IDD-ETC ) every 2 weeks vs conventional scheduled epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel ( EC→T ) ( every 3 weeks ) as adjuvant treatment in high-risk breast cancer patients . 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa in a second randomization of the intense dose-dense arm . 
One thousand two hundred eighty-four patients were enrolled ; 658 patients were randomly assigned to the IDD-ETC treatment group . 
Within the IDD-ETC group , 324 patients were further randomly assigned to the epoetin alfa group , and 319 were randomly assigned to the non-erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ( ESA ) control group . 
Primary efficacy endpoints included change in hemoglobin level from baseline to Cycle 9 and the percentage of subjects requiring red blood cell transfusion . 
Relapse-free survival , overall survival , and intramammary relapse were secondary endpoints estimated with Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods . 
Except for the primary hypothesis , all statistical tests were two-sided . 
Epoetin alfa avoided the decrease in hemoglobin level ( no decrease in the epoetin alfa group vs -2.20g/dL change for the control group ; P < .001 ) and statistically significantly reduced the percentage of subjects requiring red blood cell transfusion ( 12.8 % vs 28.1 % ; P < .0001 ) . 
The incidence of thrombotic events was 7 % in the epoetin alfa arm vs 3 % in the control arm . 
After a median follow-up of 62 months , epoetin alfa treatment did not affect overall survival , relapse-free survival , or intramammary relapse . 
Epoetin alfa resulted in improved hemoglobin levels and decreased transfusions without an impact on relapse-free or overall survival . 
However , epoetin alfa had an adverse effect , resulting in increased thrombosis . 
Capecitabine/taxane combinations are highly active in metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . 
We conducted a randomized , phase III , noninferiority trial comparing capecitabine plus paclitaxel ( XP ) with epirubicin plus paclitaxel ( EP ) as first-line therapy for MBC , regarding progression-free survival ( PFS ) as primary efficacy endpoint . 
Females who had received no prior chemotherapy for MBC were randomized to six 3-weekly cycles of XP ( capecitabine 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) b.i.d. , days 1-14 ; paclitaxel 175 mg/m ( 2 ) 3-h infusion , day 1 ) or EP ( epirubicin 60 mg/m ( 2 ) 1-h infusion , day 1 ; paclitaxel as above ) . 
Secondary endpoints included response rate , overall survival , tolerability , and quality of life ( QoL ) . 
Each arm included 170 patients , most of whom received all six cycles as planned . 
The difference in means of ( logarithmic ) PFS times ( -0.205 ) did not meet the pre-defined level for noninferiority ( -0.186 ) . 
However , PFS was similar in the two arms [ HR : XP vs. EP : 1.012 ( 95 % CI 0.785-1.304 ) ; median 10.4 months XP vs. 9.2 months EP ] . 
Overall survival was also similar [ HR 1.027 ( 95 % CI 0.740-1.424 ) ; median 22.0 vs. 26.1 months ] , and response rate was 47 % versus 42 % . 
Both regimens were tolerable : there were more grade 3/4 diarrhea and grade 3 hand-foot syndromes with XP and more grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities with EP . 
There were no major differences in QoL . 
Although , noninferiority of XP to EP was formally not proven , first-line XP was active and feasible . 
XP is a valid first-line alternative to anthracycline/taxane regimens , especially in patients previously treated with adjuvant anthracyclines . 
Androgen deprivation therapy is a common treatment in men with prostate cancer that may cause fatigue , functional decline , increased body fatness , and loss of lean body tissue . 
These physical changes can negatively affect health-related quality of life . 
Resistance exercise may help to counter some of these side effects by reducing fatigue , elevating mood , building muscle mass , and reducing body fat . 
In a two-site study , 155 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to receive androgen deprivation therapy for at least 3 months after recruitment were randomly assigned to an intervention group that participated in a resistance exercise program three times per week for 12 weeks ( 82 men ) or to a waiting list control group ( 73 men ) . 
The primary outcomes were fatigue and disease-specific quality of life as assessed by self-reported questionnaires after 12 weeks . 
Secondary outcomes were muscular fitness and body composition . 
Men assigned to resistance exercise had less interference from fatigue on activities of daily living ( P =.002 ) and higher quality of life ( P =.001 ) than men in the control group . 
Men in the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of upper body ( P =.009 ) and lower body ( P < .001 ) muscular fitness than men in the control group . 
The 12-week resistance exercise intervention did not improve body composition as measured by changes in body weight , body mass index , waist circumference , or subcutaneous skinfolds . 
Resistance exercise reduces fatigue and improves quality of life and muscular fitness in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy . 
This form of exercise can be an important component of supportive care for these patients . 
Morbidity is an important issue in cancer research . 
The observer-based toxicity scoring system used by DAHANCA ( the Danish head and neck cancer study group ) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study , but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated . 
Conversely , the EORTC quality of life questionnaire ( QLQ ) has been validated as a tool for collecting information about the consequences of disease and treatment on the well being of cancer patients . 
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the two methods of side effect recording . 
One hundred and sixteen recurrence free patients with laryngeal ( n=44 ) , pharyngeal ( n=34 ) and oral cavity ( n=38 ) cancer attending follow-up after radiotherapy ( n=83 ) or surgery ( n=33 ) completed EORTC C30 , the core questionnaire concerning general symptoms and function and EORTC H & amp ; N35 the head and neck specific questionnaire . 
The attending physicians in the follow-up clinic evaluated and recorded DAHANCA toxicity scores on the same patients . 
The DAHANCA toxicity scoring system and the EORTC QLQ correlated with several clinical endpoints . 
The conceptually similar endpoints of the two methods correlated significantly . 
The objective endpoints of the DAHANCA scoring system were only correlated with quality of life endpoints to a very low degree . 
The DAHANCA toxicity scores had a low sensitivity ( 0.48-0.74 ) in detecting equivalent subjective complaints from the questionnaires and the observer-based scoring system severely underestimated patient complaints . 
A specific patient group where the DAHANCA score had a higher tendency to fail could not be detected . 
The DAHANCA toxicity score is an effective instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients but insensitive and non-specific with regard to patient assessed subjective endpoints . 
This weakness seems inherent in an observer-based scoring system , and will probably also apply to newer ones like CTCAE 3.0 . 
To compare protracted venous infusion ( PVI ) fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) with PVI 5-FU plus mitomycin ( MMC ) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in a multicenter , prospectively randomized study . 
Two hundred eight patients were randomized to PVI 5-FU ( 300 mg/m ( 2 ) /d for a maximum of 24 weeks ) or PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( 7 mg/m ( 2 ) every 6 weeks for four courses ) . 
The major end points were tumor response , survival , toxicity , and quality of life ( QOL ) . 
The two treatment groups were balanced for baseline demographic factors , and 62 % had metastatic disease . 
The overall response rate was 8.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) 3.2 % to 13.7 % for patients treated with PVI 5-FU alone compared with 17.6 % ; 95 % CI 10.3 % to 25.1 % for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.04 ) . 
Median failure-free survival was 2.8 months for PVI 5-FU and 3.8 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.14 ) . 
Median survival was 5.1 months for PVI 5-FU and 6.5 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.34 ) . 
Toxicities in both arms were mild . 
There was an increased incidence of neutropenia in the 5-FU plus MMC arm ( P < .01 ) , although no differences in infection were seen . 
No patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome . 
Global QOL improved significantly after 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline for patients receiving 5-FU plus MMC , although there was no statistically significant difference in QOL between arms . 
PVI 5-FU plus MMC resulted in a superior response rate in comparison with PVI 5-FU alone in advanced pancreatic cancer , but this did not translate into a survival advantage . 
These results emphasize the importance of chemotherapy in this setting and the continuing value of the fluoropyrimidines in pancreatic cancer . 
Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life . 
Yoga , an ancient Eastern science , incorporates stress-reduction techniques that include regulated breathing , visual imagery , and meditation as well as various postures . 
The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga ( TY ) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor , which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization , mindfulness techniques , and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma . 
Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group . 
Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions , and patients in the wait-list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3-month follow-up assessment . 
Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions , and 58 % completed at least 5 sessions . 
Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group ( 5.8 vs. 8.1 ; P < 0.004 ) . 
This included better subjective sleep quality ( P < 0.02 ) , faster sleep latency ( P < 0.01 ) , longer sleep duration ( P < 0.03 ) , and less use of sleep medications ( P < 0.02 ) . 
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance , state anxiety , depression , or fatigue . 
The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes . 
However , there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes . 
Bone metastases occur in most women with advanced breast cancer and can lead to considerable morbidity and a rapid deterioration in the patient 's quality of life . 
It was the aim of the present study to assess changes in quality of life and bone pain due to intravenous ( i.v . ) 
ibandronate , a potent third-generation bisphosphonate . 
In a phase III randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer , 466 women were randomised to receive placebo , 2 mg ibandronate or 6 mg ibandronate for up to 96 weeks . 
Treatment was administered i.v . 
at 3- or 4-weekly intervals . 
Clinical endpoints included the incidence of adverse events , quality of life ( assessed using the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life Scale - Core 30 questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) ) , and bone pain ( assessed on a 5-point scale from 0=none to 4=intolerable ) . 
Ibandronate was generally well tolerated . 
Compared with baseline measurements , the bone pain score was increased at the last assessment in both the placebo and 2 mg ibandronate groups , but was significantly reduced in the patients receiving 6 mg ibandronate ( -0.28+/-1.11 , P < 0.001 ) . 
A significant improvement in quality of life was demonstrated for patients treated with ibandronate ( P < 0.05 ) for all global health status . 
Overall , at the last assessment , the 6 mg ibandronate group showed significantly better functioning compared with placebo ( P = 0.004 ) , and had significantly better scores on the domains of physical , emotional , and social functioning , and in global health status ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Significant improvements in the symptoms of fatigue and pain were also observed in the 6 mg ibandronate group . 
I.v . ibandronate treatment leads to significant improvements in quality of life , and is an effective and well-tolerated palliative treatment in patients with bone metastases due to breast cancer . 
Advice to rest and take things easy if patients become fatigued during radiotherapy may be detrimental . 
Aerobic walking improves physical functioning and has been an intervention for chemotherapy-related fatigue . 
A prospective , randomized , controlled trial was performed to determine whether aerobic exercise would reduce the incidence of fatigue and prevent deterioration in physical functioning during radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma . 
Sixty-six men were randomized before they received radical radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma , with 33 men randomized to an exercise group and 33 men randomized to a control group . 
Outcome measures were fatigue and distance walked in a modified shuttle test before and after radiotherapy . 
There were no significant between group differences noted with regard to fatigue scores at baseline ( P = 0.55 ) or after 4 weeks of radiotherapy ( P = 0.18 ) . 
Men in the control group had significant increases in fatigue scores from baseline to the end of radiotherapy ( P = 0.013 ) , with no significant increases observed in the exercise group ( P = 0.203 ) . 
A nonsignificant reduction ( 2.4 % ) in shuttle test distance at the end of radiotherapy was observed in the control group ; however , in the exercise group , there was a significant increase ( 13.2 % ) in distance walked ( P = 0.0003 ) . 
Men who followed advice to rest and take things easy if they became fatigued demonstrated a slight deterioration in physical functioning and a significant increase in fatigue at the end of radiotherapy . 
Home-based , moderate-intensity walking produced a significant improvement in physical functioning with no significant increase in fatigue . 
Improved physical functioning may be necessary to combat radiation fatigue . 
To determine the effects of exercise training on cardiopulmonary function and quality of life ( QOL ) in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who had completed surgery , radiotherapy , and/or chemotherapy with or without current hormone therapy use . 
Fifty-three postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to an exercise ( n = 25 ) or control ( n = 28 ) group . 
The exercise group trained on cycle ergometers three times per week for 15 weeks at a power output that elicited the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide . 
The control group did not train . 
The primary outcomes were changes in peak oxygen consumption and overall QOL from baseline to postintervention . 
Peak oxygen consumption was assessed by a graded exercise test using gas exchange analysis . 
Overall QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale . 
Fifty-two participants completed the trial . 
The exercise group completed 98.4 % of the exercise sessions . 
Baseline values for peak oxygen consumption ( P =.254 ) and overall QOL ( P =.286 ) did not differ between groups . 
Peak oxygen consumption increased by 0.24 L/min in the exercise group , whereas it decreased by 0.05 L/min in the control group ( mean difference , 0.29 L/min ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.18 to 0.40 ; P < .001 ) . 
Overall QOL increased by 9.1 points in the exercise group compared with 0.3 points in the control group ( mean difference , 8.8 points ; 95 % CI , 3.6 to 14.0 ; P =.001 ) . 
Pearson correlations indicated that change in peak oxygen consumption correlated with change in overall QOL ( r = 0.45 ; P < .01 ) . 
Exercise training had beneficial effects on cardiopulmonary function and QOL in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . 
This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed the effects of epoetin alfa on transfusion requirements , hematopoietic parameters , quality of life ( QOL ) , and safety in anemic cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy . 
The study also explored a possible relationship between increased hemoglobin and survival . 
Three hundred seventy-five patients with solid or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies and hemoglobin levels < or = 10.5 g/dL , or greater than 10.5 g/dL but < or = 12.0 g/dL after a hemoglobin decrease of > or = 1.5 g/dL per cycle since starting chemotherapy , were randomized 2:1 to epoetin alfa 150 to 300 IU/kg ( n = 251 ) or placebo ( n = 124 ) three times per week subcutaneously for 12 to 24 weeks . 
The primary end point was proportion of patients transfused ; secondary end points were change in hemoglobin and QOL . 
The protocol was amended before unblinding to prospectively collect and assess survival data 12 months after the last patient completed the study . 
Epoetin alfa , compared with placebo , significantly decreased transfusion requirements ( P =.0057 ) and increased hemoglobin ( P < .001 ) . 
Improvement of all primary cancer- and anemia-specific QOL domains , including energy level , ability to do daily activities , and fatigue , was significantly ( P < .01 ) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients . 
Although the study was not powered for survival as an end point , Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a trend in overall survival favoring epoetin alfa ( P =.13 , log-rank test ) , and Cox regression analysis showed an estimated hazards ratio of 1.309 ( P =.052 ) favoring epoetin alfa . 
Adverse events were comparable between groups . 
Epoetin alfa safely and effectively ameliorates anemia and significantly improves QOL in cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy . 
Encouraging results regarding increased survival warrant another trial designed to confirm these findings . 
To investigate whether the relative dose-intensity of cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( CHOP ) chemotherapy could be improved by prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . 
Patients aged 65 to 90 years ( median , 72 years ) with stage II to IV aggressive NHL were randomly assigned to receive standard CHOP every 3 weeks or CHOP plus G-CSF every 3 weeks on days 2 to 11 of each cycle . 
In 389 eligible patients , the relative dose intensities ( RDIs ) of cyclophosphamide ( median , 96.3 % v 93.9 % ; P =.01 ) and doxorubicin ( median , 95.4 % v 93.3 % ; P =.04 ) were higher in patients treated with CHOP plus G-CSF . 
The complete response rates were 55 % and 52 % for CHOP and CHOP plus G-CSF , respectively ( P =.63 ) . 
The actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 22 % with CHOP alone , compared with 24 % with CHOP plus G-CSF ( P =.76 ) , with a median follow-up of 33 months . 
Patients treated with CHOP plus G-CSF had an identical incidence of infections , with World Health Organization grade 3 to 4 ( 34 of 1,191 cycles v 36 of 1,195 cycles ) . 
Only the cumulative days with antibiotics were fewer with CHOP plus G-CSF ( median , 0 v 6 days ; P =.006 ) than with CHOP alone . 
The number of hospital admissions and the number of days in hospital were not different . 
In elderly patients , G-CSF improved the RDI of CHOP , but this did not lead to a higher complete response rate or better overall survival . 
G-CSF did not prevent serious infections . 
The study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with a combination of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ; Genentech , Inc , South San Francisco , CA ) and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing , metastatic breast cancer . 
A sample of 400 patients , not previously treated for metastatic disease and randomized to receive either trastuzumab plus chemotherapy ( 208 patients ) or chemotherapy alone ( 192 patients ) , completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment Care Quality of Life Questionnaire at baseline and on at least one subsequent occasion at 8 , 20 , 32 , 44 , and 56 weeks . 
HRQL improvement or worsening was defined as a > or= 10-point change ( range , 0 to 100 points ) in the scores of six preselected domains ( global quality of life [ QOL ] , physical , role , social , and emotional functioning , and fatigue ) . 
Stable HRQL was defined as a change of less than 10 . 
A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing . 
After completion of chemotherapy , patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported significant improvement in fatigue ( P < .05 ) as compared with their baseline scores . 
Higher proportions of patients receiving the combined therapy achieved improvement in global QOL ( P < .05 ) than did patients treated with chemotherapy alone . 
Higher proportions of the combined therapy group also achieved improvement in physical and role functioning and in fatigue as compared with the chemotherapy group , but the differences were not statistically significant . 
There were no differences in the proportions of patients in the two groups that reported worsening . 
Statistically significantly higher proportions of patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported improved global QOL than did patients treated by chemotherapy alone .
