We previously reported that treatment of patients with symptomatic advanced non-small cell lung cancer with single agent Gemcitabine ( GEM ) resulted in a superior clinical-benefit response rate ( RR ) compared to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy . 
We now report the detailed individual symptom control analysis , and the influence of cisplatin-use , age , performance status ( PS ) and duration of treatment . 
Patients received either GEM ( 1000 mg/m ( 2 ) , days 1 , 8 and 15 ) or cisplatin ( 100 mg/m ( 2 ) , day 1 ) plus Vindesine ( 3 mg/m ( 2 ) , days 1 and 15 ) ( PV ) , both every 4 weeks . 
Scores of 9 symptoms were listed weekly by the patient on visual analogue scales . 
Improvement of a symptom was defined as 2 consecutive cycles of improvement over baseline . 
Baseline symptoms in the 169 patients were well balanced between the 2 arms ( 84 GEM , 85 PV ) . 
Both patients with objective response and disease stabilisation had clearly better symptom control than those with disease progression . 
Symptom control in both arms was similar for 'disease-specific ' symptoms such as cough , dyspnea , pain or haemoptysis . 
Compared to PV , a significantly larger number of GEM-patients had better scores for 'constitutional ' items such as anorexia ( P=0.007 ) , ability to carry on with daily activities ( P=0.04 ) and overall impression of quality-of-life ( P=0.008 ) . 
Symptom control was very similar in younger ( < 65 years ) versus older ( > /=65 years ) patients , and only slightly better in those with a Karnofsky PS > /=80 % compared to those < 80 % . 
Most of the symptom improvement occurred in the first 3 cycles , with some further symptom improvement in the following cycles in the GEM-arm only . 
Both GEM and PV yield a symptom control rate much higher than expected by the objective tumour RR . 
GEM is equally effective in controlling 'disease-specific ' symptoms , but superior in controlling 'constitutional ' symptoms . 
Most of the symptom control was achieved during the first 3 cycles of treatment , with some further improvement thereafter in the GEM-arm only . 
To compare 1-year outcomes of illuminated microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy ( IMCT ) vs conventional partial trabeculotomy ( CPT ) for primary congenital glaucoma ( PCG ) . 
Forty eyes of 31 patients with unilateral or bilateral primary congenital glaucoma aged less than 2 years were randomized to undergo IMCT ( 20 eyes ) or CPT ( 20 eyes ) . 
Primary outcome measure was intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction . 
The success criterion was defined as IOP ≤ 12 mm Hg without and with antiglaucoma medications ( absolute success and qualified success , respectively ) . 
The mean age of our study population was 8.35 ± 1.2 months . 
The mean preoperative IOP was 24.70 ± 3.90 mm Hg in the IMCT group and 24.60 ± 3.31 mm Hg in the CPT group . 
Both groups were comparable with respect to preoperative IOP , corneal clarity , corneal diameter , vertical cup-to-disc ratio , and refractive error . 
In the IMCT group , 360-degree cannulation was achieved in 80 % ( 16/20 ) of eyes . 
For the IMCT group and CPT groups , respectively , the absolute success rates were 80 % ( 16/20 ) and 60 % ( 12/20 ) ( P < .001 ) and qualified success rates were 90 % ( 18/20 ) and 70 % ( 14/20 ) ( P < .001 ) . 
Both procedures produced a statistically significant reduction in IOP , and eyes undergoing IMCT achieved a lower IOP than CPT group eyes at 12 months follow-up ( 9.5 ± 2.4 mm Hg and 11.7 ± 2.1 mm Hg , respectively , P < .001 ) . 
In primary congential glaucoma , illuminated microcatheter-assisted 360-degree circumferential trabeculotomy performed better than conventional partial trabeculotomy at 1 year follow-up and resulted in significantly lower IOP measurements . 
The oral Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 7 agonist GS-9620 has antiviral effects in woodchuck and chimpanzee models of chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . 
We investigated , in a clinical trial , the capacity of this agent to reconstitute protective immunity in patients with chronic HBV infection . 
We performed a prospective study of 28 patients with suppression of HBV infection by nucleos ( t ) ide analogue therapy and who tested negative for hepatitis B e antigen at 4 medical centers in Italy . 
Patients were randomly assigned ( 1:3:3:3 ) to groups given placebo or different doses of GS-9620 ( 1 , 2 , and 4 mg , weekly for 12 weeks ) . 
We added data from 8 patients receiving nucleos ( t ) ide analogue therapy to the placebo group ( controls ) ; 13 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection and 15 subjects who spontaneously recovered from an acute HBV infection served as additional controls . 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at baseline , during administration of GS-9620 or placebo , and 12 weeks afterward . 
Phenotype and function of natural killer ( NK ) and HBV-specific T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry . 
T cells were expanded by incubation with peptides from the entire HBV proteome and studied after overnight or 10 days culture . 
NK-cell inhibition of T-cell responses was measured by assessing cytokine production by T cells stimulated with peptides in the presence or absence of NK cells . 
T cells collected at baseline before addition of GS-9620 , when patients were receiving only nucleos ( t ) ide therapy , had greater responses to HBV than T cells from treatment-naïve patients , based on cytokine production in response to HBV peptides . 
However , during or after administration of GS-9620 , T cells produced higher levels of cytokines compared to baseline . 
NK-cell activation and function increased after patients were given GS-9620 , but the ability of NK cells to suppress T-cell responses was lower during GS-9620 therapy than before . 
Changes in T-cell or NK-cell function did not correlate with levels of hepatitis B surface antigen . 
Serum levels of hepatitis B surface antigen did not decrease significantly compared to baseline in patients given any dose of GS-9620 . 
Twelve weeks administration of GS-9620 had no significant effect on serum hepatitis B surface antigen levels , but did appear to increase T-cell and NK-cell responses and reduce the ability of NK to suppress T cells . 
GS-9620 might therefore be included in therapies to increase the immune response to HBV . 
Adherence to appropriate nutrition and fluid intake is one of the essential parts of chronic renal failure treatment for achieving the desirable results among the patients with hemodialysis . 
Among various training methods , the " small groups ' method " , as an advanced method , can be performed by nurses in achieving desirable therapeutic results . 
The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of appropriate nutrition training in small groups on laboratory parameters in hemodialysis patients . 
In this clinical trial , 64 patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly selected and divided into an intervention group and a control group . 
Subsequently , an appropriate nutritional training program , including lectures along with appropriate nutrition pamphlets in three one hour question and answer sessions were performed . 
Thirty two patients in each group were assigned to intervention groups of five . 
Then , the laboratory indicators for each patient were measured in each group one month after training . 
Thereafter , data analysis was performed using descriptive and analytical statistics ( statistical tests including independent t-test , paired t-test , repeated measures , and ANOVA ) in SPSS V.16 software . 
The mean age of the patients was 50.1 ± 13.1 years ; 47.5 % of them had undergone dialysis due to hypertension and 55.7 % had a history of 1-5 years of hemodialysis . 
There was a significant difference in post-intervention levels of urea , creatinine , sodium , potassium , calcium , and phosphorus between the two groups . 
Appropriate nutrition training via small-group method for patients on hemodialysis can impose positive effects on laboratory parameters . 
In patients with chronic hepatitis B , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) plus pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) for 48-weeks results in higher rates of hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) loss than either monotherapy . 
To identify baseline and on-treatment factors associated with HBsAg loss at Week 72 and provide a model for predicting HBsAg loss in patients receiving combination therapy for 48 weeks . 
A secondary analysis of data from an open-label study where patients were randomised to TDF ( 300 mg/day , oral ) plus PEG-IFN ( PI , 180 μg/week , subcutaneous ) for 48 weeks ( TDF/PI-48w ) ; TDF plus PEG-IFN for 16 weeks , TDF for 32 weeks ( TDF/PI-16w+TDF-32w ) ; TDF for 120 weeks ( TDF-120w ) or PEG-IFN for 48 weeks ( PI-48w ) . 
Logistic regression methods were used to identify models that best predicted HBsAg loss at Week 72 . 
Rates of HBsAg loss at Week 72 were significantly higher in the TDF/PI-48w group ( 6.5 % ) than in the TDF/PI-16w+TDF-32w ( 0.5 % ) , TDF-120w ( 0 % ) and PI-48w ( 2.2 % ) groups ( P = 0.09 ) . 
The only baseline factor associated with response was genotype A. HBsAg decline at Week 12 or 24 of treatment was associated with HBsAg loss at Week 72 ( P < 0.001 ) . 
HBsAg decline > 3.5 log10 IU/mL at Week 24 in the TDF/PI-48w group resulted in a positive predictive value of 85 % and a negative predictive value of 99 % for HBsAg loss at Week 72 . 
HBsAg decline at Week 24 of TDF plus PEG-IFN combination therapy may identify patients who , after completing 48 weeks of treatment , have a better chance of achieving HBsAg loss at Week 72 . 
The aim of this work is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of preservative containing 0.0015 % tafluprost and preservative-free 0.0015 % tafluprost using a prospective crossover study . 
Primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and normotensive glaucoma ( NTG ) patients were randomized enrolled . 
Group 1 ( " NPT to PT " ) patients used preservative-free 0.0015 % tafluprost ( NPT ) for 6 months and then changed to preservative containing 0.0015 % tafluprost ( PT ) for 6 months . 
Group 2 ( " PT to NPT " ) patients used preservative containing 0.0015 % tafluprost for 6 months and changed to preservative-free 0.0015 % tafluprost for 6 months . 
At 1 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , and 12 months , we measured intraocular pressure for efficacy and graded corneal erosion , tear break-up time ( TBUT ) , and subjective discomfort . 
A total of 20 patients and 20 eyes were enrolled . 
In Group 1 and 2 , intraocular pressure was well controlled to approximately 14 mmHg ( 9.38-18.46 % decrease ) . 
Generally , subjective satisfaction was improved after changing from PT to NPT ( p = 0.03 ) and TBUT using PT was numerically inferior to that using NPT ( p = 0.06 ) but not when changing from NPT to PT . 
Both preservative containing and preservative-free 0.0015 % tafluprost reduced intraocular pressure significantly . 
In addition , changing medication from PT to NPT might improve subjective satisfaction and tear break up time . 
To compare phacoemulsification versus trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C in medically uncontrolled chronic angle-closure glaucoma ( CACG ) without cataract . 
Prospective , randomized clinical trial . 
Fifty medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract of 50 patients . 
Patients were randomized into undergoing either phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C. After surgery , patients were followed up every 3 months for 2 years . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and requirement for glaucoma drugs . 
Twenty-six CACG eyes were randomized to receive phacoemulsification , and 24 eyes underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery ( reduction of 8.4 mmHg or 34 % for phacoemulsification vs 8.9 mmHg or 36 % for trabeculectomy ; P=0.76 ) . 
Over first 24 months , trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes ( P < 0.001 ) . 
However , trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification ( 46 % vs 4 % ; P=0.001 ) . 
Eight ( 33 % ) of 24 trabeculectomy eyes demonstrated cataract during follow-up . 
Both phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy are effective in reducing IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract . 
Trabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing dependence on glaucoma drugs , but is associated with more complications . 
Uncontrolled hypertension is a major problem among non-Hispanic black men , who are underrepresented in pharmacist intervention trials in traditional health care settings . 
We enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more from 52 black-owned barbershops ( nontraditional health care setting ) in a cluster-randomized trial in which barbershops were assigned to a pharmacist-led intervention ( in which barbers encouraged meetings in barbershops with specialty-trained pharmacists who prescribed drug therapy under a collaborative practice agreement with the participants ’ doctors ) or to an active control approach ( in which barbers encouraged lifestyle modification and doctor appointments ) . 
The primary outcome was reduction in systolic blood pressure at 6 months . 
At baseline , the mean systolic blood pressure was 152.8 mm Hg in the intervention group and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group . 
At 6 months , the mean systolic blood pressure fell by 27.0 mm Hg ( to 125.8 mm Hg ) in the intervention group and by 9.3 mm Hg ( to 145.4 mm Hg ) in the control group ; the mean reduction was 21.6 mm Hg greater with the intervention ( 95 % confidence interval , 14.7 to 28.4 ; P < 0.001 ) . 
A blood-pressure level of less than 130/80 mm Hg was achieved among 63.6 % of the participants in the intervention group versus 11.7 % of the participants in the control group ( P < 0.001 ) . 
In the intervention group , the rate of cohort retention was 95 % , and there were few adverse events ( three cases of acute kidney injury ) . 
Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled hypertension , health promotion by barbers resulted in larger blood-pressure reduction when coupled with medication management in barbershops by specialty-trained pharmacists . 
Treatment-related quality of life ( QOL ) is an important aspect of diabetes management . 
However , no studies have compared the influence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors versus alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on treatment-related QOL . 
This prespecified sub-analysis of the Linagliptin Study of Effects on Postprandial blood glucose ( L-STEP ) compared the effects of linagliptin ( 5 mg once daily ) and voglibose ( 0.2 mg/meal thrice daily ) on treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) inadequately controlled with diet and exercise therapy . 
Among 366 subjects in the original study , 182 in the linagliptin group and 173 in the voglibose group were included in this analysis . 
The outcome of this study was change in QOL as assessed by the Diabetes Therapy-Related Quality of Life 17 ( DTR-QOL17 ) questionnaire from baseline to week 12 . 
Compared with baseline data , total DTR-QOL17 scores were significantly higher after 12 weeks of linagliptin and voglibose treatment . 
The change in the total DTR-QOL17 score and the score of one domain , burden on social activities and daily activities , was significantly greater in the linagliptin group than in the voglibose group . 
In addition , only linagliptin treatment was identified as a factor associated with an increased total DTR-QOL17 score . 
Linagliptin is superior to voglibose in terms of improving treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with T2DM . 
Long-term treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) alone , or in combination with emtricitabine ( FTC ) is associated with sustained viral suppression in patients with lamivudine resistant ( LAM-R ) chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) . 
LAM-R CHB patients were randomised 1:1 to receive TDF 300mg or FTC 200mg and TDF 300mg once daily in a prospective , double blind , study . 
The proportion of patients with plasma hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA < 69IU/ml ( < 400copies/ml ) at week 96 ( primary efficacy endpoint ) was reported previously . 
Here we present week 240 follow-up data . 
Overall , 280 patients were randomised to receive TDF ( n=141 ) or FTC/TDF ( n=139 ) , and 85.4 % completed 240 weeks of treatment . 
At week 240 , 83.0 % of patients in the TDF arm , and 82.7 % of patients in the FTC/TDF treatment arm had HBV DNA < 69IU/ml ( p=0.96 ) . 
Rates of normal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and normalised ALT were similar between groups ( p=0.41 and p=0.97 respectively ) . 
Hepatitis B e antigen loss and seroconversion at week 240 were similar between groups , ( p=0.41 and p=0.67 respectively ) . 
Overall , six patients achieved hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) loss and one patient ( FTC/TDF arm ) had HBsAg seroconversion by week 240 . 
No TDF resistance was observed up to week 240 . 
Treatment was generally well tolerated , and renal events were mild and infrequent ( ∼8.6 % ) . 
The mean change in bone mineral density at week 240 was -0.98 % and -2.54 % at the spine and hip , respectively . 
TDF monotherapy was effective and well tolerated in LAM-R CHB patients for up to 240 weeks . 
The goal of oral antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) is to achieve and maintain undetectable HBV DNA levels . 
Treatment options with enhanced potency , and low risk of resistance development for patients infected with lamivudine resistant ( LAM-R ) HBV are required . 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) monotherapy was effective and well tolerated without TDF resistance development in CHB patients with LAM-R , for up to 240weeks . 
To compare the outcome of trabeculectomy using adjunctive intracameral bevacizumab versus intraoperative mitomycin C ( MMC ) . 
In this double-blind , randomized clinical trial 87 eyes of 87 patients with primary open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma were assigned to each treatment group ( 44 cases received 1.25 mg intracameral bevacizumab at the end of operation and in 43 cases MMC was applied during surgery ) . 
Success was defined as intraocular pressure ( IOP ) between 6 and 21 mm Hg and at least 30 % IOP drop with ( qualified ) or without ( complete ) glaucoma medications without additional glaucoma surgery . 
The follow-up time was 17.12±2.58 months in the bevacizumab group and 17.23±2.42 months in the MMC group ( P=0.845 ) . 
The preoperative IOP was 29.17±3.94 and 28.8±4.08 mm Hg in the bevacizumab and MMC groups , respectively ( P=0.689 ) . 
Last visit IOP was 17.41±3.11 mm Hg in the bevacizumab group and 15.34±3.62 mm Hg in the MMC group ( P < 0.009 ) . 
Compared with baseline , IOP drop at last visit was 11.76±5.51 and 13.43±5.92 in the bevacizumab and MMC groups , respectively ( P=0.207 ) . 
At last visit , complete success was achieved in 25 cases ( 61 % ) of bevacizumab group and 23 cases ( 66 % ) of MMC group ( P=0.669 ) . 
Early filtering bleb leak was more prevalent in bevacizumab group ( 29 % vs. 11 % ) . 
A single 1.25 mg dose of intracameral bevacizumab improves the success of trabeculectomy comparable with MMC ; however , it increases the risk of early filtering bleb leakage . 
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of gefitinib ( Iressa [ ZD1839 ] ; AstraZeneca , Wilmington , DE ) , a novel epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , in patients with pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . 
This was a randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter phase II trial . 
Two hundred ten patients with advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with one or two chemotherapy regimens ( at least one containing platinum ) were randomly assigned to receive either 250-mg or 500-mg oral doses of gefitinib once daily . 
Efficacy was similar for the 250- and 500-mg/d groups . 
Objective tumor response rates were 18.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 11.5 to 27.3 ) and 19.0 % ( 95 % CI , 12.1 to 27.9 ) ; among evaluable patients , symptom improvement rates were 40.3 % ( 95 % CI , 28.5 to 53.0 ) and 37.0 % ( 95 % CI , 26.0 to 49.1 ) ; median progression-free survival times were 2.7 and 2.8 months ; and median overall survival times were 7.6 and 8.0 months , respectively . 
Symptom improvements were recorded for 69.2 % ( 250 mg/d ) and 85.7 % ( 500 mg/d ) of patients with a tumor response . 
Adverse events ( AEs ) at both dose levels were generally mild ( grade 1 or 2 ) and consisted mainly of skin reactions and diarrhea . 
Drug-related toxicities were more frequent in the higher-dose group . 
Withdrawal due to drug-related AEs was 1.9 % and 9.4 % for patients receiving gefitinib 250 and 500 mg/d , respectively . 
Gefitinib showed clinically meaningful antitumor activity and provided symptom relief as second- and third-line treatment in these patients . 
At 250 mg/d , gefitinib had a favorable AE profile . 
Gefitinib 250 mg/d is an important , novel treatment option for patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC . 
Multiple studies have evaluated the hypoglycemic effect of cinnamon in patients with diabetes mellitus ( DM ) type II , with conflicting results . 
Differences in Baseline Body Mass Index ( BMI ) of patients may be able to explain the observed differences in the results . 
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of cinnamon supplementation on anthropometric , glycemic and lipid outcomes of patients with DM type II based on their baseline BMI . 
The study was designed as a triple-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial , using a parallel design . 
One hundred and forty patients referred to Diabetes Clinic of Yazd University of Medical Sciences with diagnosis of DM type II were randomly assigned in four groups : cinnamon ( BMI ≥ 27 , BMI < 27 ) and Placebo ( BMI ≥ 27 , BMI < 27 ) . 
Patients received cinnamon bark powder or placebo in 500 mg capsules twice daily for 3 months . 
Anthropometric , glycemic and lipid outcomes were measured before and after the intervention . 
Cinnamon supplementation led to improvement of all anthropometric ( BMI , body fat , and visceral fat ) , glycemic ( FPG , 2hpp , HbA1C , Fasting Insulin , and Insulin Resistance ) , and lipids ( Cholesterol Total , LDL-c and HDL-c ) outcomes ( except for triglycerides level ) . 
All observed changes ( except for Cholesterol Total and LDL-c ) were significantly more prominent in patients with higher baseline BMI ( BMI ≥ 27 ) . 
Based on the study findings , cinnamon may improve anthropometric parameters , glycemic indices and lipid profile of patients with type II diabetes . 
These benefits are significantly more prominent in patients with higher baseline BMI ( BMI ≥ 27 ) . 
Although anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents for treating B-cell lymphoma , adverse effects , such as bone marrow suppression and cardiotoxicity , limit their clinical application . 
We assessed whether anthracycline treatment also increases the risk for diabetes mellitus in patients with B-cell lymphoma . 
Using data obtained from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database from 2004 to 2011 , we compared overall survival and clinical features for B-cell lymphoma patients administered anthracyclines ( n = 3147 ) and those not administered anthracyclines ( n = 837 ) . 
The impact of anthracycline treatment on diabetes risk was further investigated using a Gray 's test and multivariate competing-risk regression models in a dose-dependent manner . 
Anthracycline administration was associated with a higher incidence of diabetes ( HR : 1.75 ; 95 % CI 1.11-2.75 ; p = 0.0163 ) after adjustments for age , gender , cumulative dose of prednisolone , and co-morbidities . 
Cumulative anthracycline doses of 253-400 mg ( HR : 2.35 ; 95 % CI 1.41-3.91 ; p = 0.0010 ) , 401-504 mg ( HR : 2.26 ; 95 % CI 1.26-4.05 ; p = 0.0063 ) , and > 504 mg ( HR : 2.29 ; 95 % CI 1.25-4.18 ; p = 0.0072 ) increased the incidence density of diabetes in a dose-dependent manner ( p = 0.0006 ) . 
The annual alteration of adapted diabetes complications severity index score was not significantly different between B-cell lymphoma patients with or without anthracycline treatment ( p = 0.4924 ) . 
Anthracycline therapy increases diabetes risk in a dose-dependent manner in B-cell lymphoma patients . 
Intensive blood glucose monitoring and control should be recommended for B-cell lymphoma patients receiving anthracycline treatment . 
Combination therapy has been recommended for the treatment of patients harboring multiple drug-resistant hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . 
However , we recently demonstrated that monotherapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) for 48 weeks displayed noninferior efficacy to TDF plus entecavir ( ETV ) combination therapy in patients with HBV resistant to multiple drugs , including ETV and adefovir . 
Nonetheless , whether prolonged TDF monotherapy would be safe and increase the virologic response rate in these patients was unclear . 
Among 192 patients with HBV-resistance mutations to ETV and/or adefovir , who were randomized to receive TDF monotherapy ( n = 95 ) or TDF/ETV combination therapy ( n = 97 ) for 48 weeks , 189 agreed to continue TDF monotherapy ( TDF-TDF group ) or to switch to TDF monotherapy ( TDF/ETV-TDF group ) and 180 ( 93.8 % ) completed the 144-week study . 
Serum HBV DNA < 15 IU/mL at week 48 , the primary efficacy endpoint , was achieved in 66.3 % in the TDF-TDF group and 68.0 % in the TDF/ETV-TDF group ( P = 0.80 ) . 
At week 144 , the proportion with HBV DNA < 15 IU/mL increased to 74.5 % , which was significantly higher compared with that at week 48 ( P = 0.03 ) , without a significant difference between groups ( P = 0.46 ) . 
By on-treatment analysis , a total of 79.4 % had HBV DNA < 15 IU/mL at week 144 . 
Transient virologic breakthrough occurred in 6 patients , which was due to poor drug adherence . 
At week 144 , 19 patients who had HBV DNA levels > 60 IU/mL qualified for genotypic resistance analysis , and 6 retained some of their baseline resistance mutations of HBV . 
No patients developed additional resistance mutations throughout the study period . 
TDF monotherapy was efficacious and safe for up to 144 weeks , providing an increasing rate of virologic response in heavily pretreated patients with multidrug-resistant HBV . 
To estimate the real-world effects of offering a group-based lifestyle intervention ( GLI ) to adults with diabetes . 
This randomized encouragement trial included adult primary care patients in metropolitan Chicago with type 2 diabetes and body mass index ≥24 kg/m2 . 
Participants were randomized to standard care ( brief dietary and lifestyle counseling ) or standard care plus being encouraged , but not required , to participate in a free-of-charge GLI offered by the YMCA . 
The GLI was a group-based adaptation of the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention . 
Of 331 participants , 167 were randomized to standard care and 164 to the GLI encouragement arm . 
About one third of participants were non-Hispanic White ( 34.4 % ) . 
In the GLI arm , 75 ( 45.7 % ) attended ≥1 GLI visits . 
In the primary intention-to-treat analysis , the effect of GLI encouragement was 0.95 % weight loss at six months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.13-1.77 % ; P = 0.02 ) , and 1.20 % weight loss at 12 months ( 95 % CI , 0.05-2.36 % ; P = 0.04 ) . 
At 12 months , there was a 0.30 % ( 3.3 mmol/mol ) reduction in hemoglobin A1c , but this result did not achieve statistical significance ( P = 0.054 ) . 
In instrumental variable analysis estimating effects among the subgroup of participants who attended any GLI visits , the effect of GLI attendance was 2.30 % weight loss at six months ( 95 % CI , 0.30-4.30 % ; P = 0.02 ) , and 2.07 % weight loss at 12 months ( 95 % CI , 0.25-3.88 % ; P = 0.02 ) . 
We detected no significant blood pressure or cholesterol effects . 
Among adults with type 2 diabetes , a group-based lifestyle intervention in a community-based setting achieved modest weight loss at 6 and 12 months . 
To determine the safety and efficacy of oral bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ; Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated , San Diego , Calif ) . 
The effects of 2 randomized doses of 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( with crossover for progression ) vs 650 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( later modified to 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ) were evaluated in an open-label , multicenter , phase 2 and 3 study conducted between February 1997 and November 1998 . 
Eighteen international cutaneous T-cell lymphoma clinics at academic referral centers . 
Fifty-eight patients with biopsy-proven stage IA through IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that was refractory to ( or patients were intolerant of ) treatment or had reached at least a 6-month response plateau under at least 2 forms of prior therapy ( median of 3.5 prior therapies ) . 
Bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ) administered once daily with meal for 16 weeks or longer . 
Primary end point classification of overall response rate of complete and partial remissions determined by either the Physician 's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition or the objective Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity . 
Body surface area , time to response , duration of disease control , time to disease progression , individual index lesion signs and symptoms , and quality of life parameters were secondary outcomes . 
Responses ( > or = 50 % improvement ) were seen in 3 ( 20 % ) of 15 patients with an initial dose at 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 % -40 % ) , 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients at 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % CI , 35 % -72 % ) , and 10 ( 67 % ) of 15 patients at above 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day ( 95 % CI , 43 % -91 % ) . 
The rate of progressive disease was 47 % , 21 % , and 13 % at the same dose levels , respectively . 
Eight ( 73 % ) of 11 patients crossing over from 6.5 mg/m ( 2 ) per day to higher doses subsequently responded . 
The median duration of response from start of therapy could not be estimated for the 15 patients at 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day owing to low relapse rates in 2 patients ( 13 % ) ; at higher doses it was 516 days . 
The following drug-related adverse effects were reversible and treatable : hypertriglyceridemia ( 46 patients [ 79 % ] ) , hypercholesterolemia ( 28 patients [ 48 % ] ) , headache ( 27 patients [ 47 % ] ) , central hypothyroidism ( 23 patients [ 40 % ] ) , asthenia ( 21 patients [ 36 % ] ) , and leukopenia ( 16 patients [ 28 % ] ) . 
No cases of drug-related neutropenic fever , sepsis , or death occurred . 
Pancreatitis occurred in 3 patients with triglyceride levels higher than 14.69 mmol/L ( 1300 mg/dL ) , all of whom were taking 300 mg/m ( 2 ) or more of oral bexarotene per day . 
Bexarotene ( Targretin capsules ) ( the first retinoid X receptor-selective rexinoid ) was well tolerated and effective as an oral treatment for 15 ( 54 % ) of 28 patients with refractory or persistent early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma at doses of 300 mg/m ( 2 ) per day . 
Hypertriglyceridemia and hypothyroidism require monitoring but are reversible and manageable with concomitant medication . 
Few controlled clinical trials exist to support oral combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . 
Patients with PAH ( idiopathic [ IPAH ] or associated with connective tissue disease [ APAH-CTD ] ) taking bosentan ( 62.5 or 125 mg twice daily at a stable dose for ≥3 months ) were randomized ( 1:1 ) to sildenafil ( 20 mg , 3 times daily ; n = 50 ) or placebo ( n = 53 ) . 
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) at week 12 , assessed using analysis of covariance . 
Patients could continue in a 52-week extension study . 
An analysis of covariance main-effects model was used , which included categorical terms for treatment , baseline 6MWD ( < 325 m ; ≥325 m ) , and baseline aetiology ; sensitivity analyses were subsequently performed . 
In sildenafil versus placebo arms , week-12 6MWD increases were similar ( least squares mean difference [ sildenafil-placebo ] , -2.4 m [ 90 % CI : -21.8 to 17.1 m ] ; P = 0.6 ) ; mean ± SD changes from baseline were 26.4 ± 45.7 versus 11.8 ± 57.4 m , respectively , in IPAH ( 65 % of population ) and -18.3 ± 82.0 versus 17.5 ± 59.1 m in APAH-CTD ( 35 % of population ) . 
One-year survival was 96 % ; patients maintained modest 6MWD improvements . 
Changes in WHO functional class and Borg dyspnoea score and incidence of clinical worsening did not differ . 
Headache , diarrhoea , and flushing were more common with sildenafil . 
Sildenafil , in addition to stable ( ≥3 months ) bosentan therapy , had no benefit over placebo for 12-week change from baseline in 6MWD . 
The influence of PAH aetiology warrants future study . 
Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma , nasal type ( ENKTL ) is a rare subtype of lymphoma that is often associated with poor clinical prognosis . 
Several studies have shown that hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection may be associated with increased risk of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ; however , because of the rarity of ENKTL , little is known about its association with HBV . 
Our study aimed to assess whether HBV infection was associated with increased odds of ENKTL . 
We conducted a hospital-based case-control study including 417 ENKTL cases and 488 age- and sex-matched subjects with nonmalignant diseases unrelated to HBV infection . 
Multivariable unconditional logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios [ AOR ] and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) . 
The results of the multivariable analysis showed that after adjustment for a set of known risk factors , patients previously infected with HBV ( HBsAg-seronegative/anti-HBc-seropositive ) and naturally immune to HBV ( anti-HBs-seropositive/anti-HBc-seropositive ) were at significantly greater odds of being diagnosed with ENKTL ( AOR , 1.497 ; 95 % CI 1.098-2.042 , P=0.033 and AOR , 1.871 ; 95 % CI 1.302-2.689 , P=0.001 , respectively ) . 
After adjusting for other factors , significantly greater odds of being diagnosed with ENKTL were observed among cases who reported ever drinking alcohol ( AOR , 1.675 ; 95 % CI 1.054-2.660 , P=0.029 ) . 
The odds of ENKTL diagnosis were not significantly associated with ABO blood type , cigarette smoking status or family history of cancer . 
The results of our study suggest that patients previously infected with HBV and naturally immune to HBV were at greater odds of being diagnosed with ENKTL . 
We assessed bleb morphology and the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering effect of trabeculectomy with ologen compared to mitomycin C ( MMC ) in juvenile open-angle glaucoma ( JOAG ) .This is a prospective interventional comparative study conducted on 40 eyes ( 20 patients ) with medically uncontrolled JOAG , randomly operating one eye for trabeculectomy with ologen ( group A : 20 eyes ) and the other with MMC ( group B : 20 eyes ) . 
IOP measurement , SITA standard perimetry , and spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) for retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness were all done pre- and postoperatively . 
Postoperative blebs were assessed clinically using the Moorfields bleb grading system ( MBGS ) and anterior segment OCT ( AS-OCT ) . 
All patients were examined for up to 1 year postoperatively . 
The mean postoperative IOP was statistically significantly lower than the mean preoperative IOP at each follow-up in each group . 
At 1 year , the mean postoperative IOP was significantly lower in group A . 
According to the MBGS , blebs with an ologen implant showed significantly better scoring than those with MMC . 
AS-OCT showed that ologen-induced blebs had significantly more fluid-filled spaces , cleavage planes , and less fibrosis . 
Ologen resulted in a lower long-term postoperative IOP , a better bleb morphology , and fewer complications . 
Our results suggest that ologen may be a useful alternative to MMC in JOAG . 
KAMUT khorasan is an ancient grain with widely acclaimed health benefits . 
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a replacement diet with ancient khorasan wheat products in patients with NAFLD , in comparison to a similar replacement diet with control products made from organic semi-whole-grain modern wheat . 
Forty NAFLD patients ( 12 M/28 F ; age 55.2 ± 10.4 years ) with mild to moderate liver steatosis were included . 
The experimental design was a randomized , double-blind , parallel-arm study with 20 participants assigned to consume either KAMUT khorasan or control wheat products ( pasta , bread , crackers , biscuits ) over a 3-month period . 
Anthropometric measurements , blood analyses , and ultrasonography examination were performed at both the beginning and end of each dietary intervention . 
After the implementation of a general linear model for repeated measurements adjusted for baseline demographic details , risk factors , and medication , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) was significantly reduced by 12 % , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) by 14 % , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) by 8 % , and cholesterol by 6 % only in the khorasan group ( p < 0.05 for all ) . 
Similarly , significant reductions in circulating proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 50 % , interleukin l-receptor antagonist-alpha by 37 % , interleukin-8 by 24 % , and interferon gamma by 24 % were evident only in participants who consumed the khorasan products ( p < 0.05 for all ) . 
Finally , significant improvements in the liver steatosis grading , Doppler perfusion index values , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production were evident after consumption of both the khorasan and control products . 
This study suggests that a short-term replacement diet with ancient KAMUT khorasan products is most effective in reducing metabolic risk factors and ameliorating the liver profile in patients with NAFLD . 
The role of gut microbiota in the management of diabetes is shown . 
In this randomized clinical trial we assessed the effects of synbiotic supplementation on insulin , lipid profile and antioxidative status among women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) . 
Ninety pregnant women with GDM were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either a daily synbiotic capsule - consisting of L. acidophilus , L. plantarum , L. fermentum , L. gasseri ( 1.5-7.0 × 109-10 CFU/g ) - with fructooligosaccharide ( 38.5 mg ) , or placebo for 6 weeks . 
Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) , insulin , homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , quantitative insulin sensitivity check index ( QUICKI ) , high- and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C , LDL-C ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglycerides ( TG ) , total antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) , and systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( SBP , DSP ) were assessed before and after the intervention . 
No significant changes in FPG , insulin resistance/sensitivity , lipid profile and TAC indices were seen in synbiotic group compared to the placebo one ( p > 0.05 ) . 
Significant within group increases for HDL-C and TAC levels in synbiotic group were observed ( p < 0.05 ) . 
LDL-C showed significant increment in the placebo group compared to the baseline of the study ( 6.9 mg/dL , p < 0.05 ) . 
Between group comparison showed significant decrease in SBP and DBP in synbiotic group compared to placebo ( -2.5 vs. 8.6 mmHg , and -1.8 vs. 2.1 mmHg , p < 0.05 ) . 
The results showed that , in women with GDM , synbiotic supplementation had no effect on FPG and insulin resistance/sensitivity indices . 
Lipid profile and TAC status may be affected by synbiotic supplementation . 
Synbiotic is effective in reducing of blood pressure in women with GDM . 
Hepatotoxicity associated with isoniazid preventive therapy ( IPT ) and antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) has not been well studied in severely immunosuppressed people with HIV . 
Our objective was to determine risk factors for hepatotoxicity in severely immunosuppressed individuals taking IPT and ART . 
Multicenter study in resource-limited settings with high burden of tuberculosis . 
We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 1 randomized arm of the REMEMBER trial . 
The analysis includes participants with pre-ART CD4 cell counts of < 50 cells/μL receiving IPT and ART for 24 weeks . 
Hepatotoxicity was defined as elevated aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) > 5 × upper limit of normal or symptomatic hepatitis during IPT and ART . 
Logistic regression was used to identify baseline risk factors for hepatotoxicity . 
Time to occurrence of hepatotoxicity was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method . 
Among 426 participants ( 53 % male , median age 35 years , median CD4 count 19 cells/µL ) , 31 developed hepatotoxicity ( 7.3 % ) . 
Raised pretreatment AST/ALT ( odds ratio [ OR ] 3.6 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.7 to 7.7 ) and hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) seropositivity at baseline ( OR 4.7 , 95 % CI : 1.7 to 12.9 ) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing hepatotoxicity . 
Participants with both raised AST/ALT and positive HBsAg had a higher risk ( OR 19.9 , 95 % CI : 5.3 to 74.3 ) and earlier onset of hepatotoxicity than participants who did not have these conditions at baseline . 
The incidence of hepatotoxicity during IPT and ART was high . 
Severely immunosuppressed individuals with raised pretreatment AST/ALT or HBsAg seropositivity need closer monitoring for hepatotoxicity . 
To determine predictors of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) involving syncope , hypotension , and falls , with particular attention to age , in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial . 
Academic and private practices across the United States ( N = 102 ) . 
Adults aged 50 and older with a systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) of 130 to 180 mmHg at high risk of cardiovascular disease events , but without diabetes , history of stroke , symptomatic heart failure or ejection fraction less than 35 % , dementia , or standing SBP less than 110 mmHg ( N = 9,361 ) . 
Treatment of SBP to a goal of less than 120 mmHg or 140 mmHg . 
Outcomes were SAEs involving syncope , hypotension , and falls . 
Predictors were treatment assignment , demographic characteristics , comorbidities , baseline measurements , and baseline use of cardiovascular medications . 
One hundred seventy-two ( 1.8 % ) participants had SAEs involving syncope , 155 ( 1.6 % ) hypotension , and 203 ( 2.2 % ) falls . 
Randomization to intensive SBP control was associated with greater risk of an SAE involving hypotension ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 1.67 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 1.21-2.32 , P = .002 ) , and possibly syncope ( HR = 1.32 , 95 % CI = 0.98-1.79 , P = .07 ) , but not falls ( HR = 0.98 , 95 % CI = 0.75-1.29 , P = .90 ) . 
Risk of all three outcomes was higher for participants with chronic kidney disease or frailty . 
Older age was also associated with greater risk of syncope , hypotension , and falls , but there was no age-by-treatment interaction for any of the SAE outcomes . 
Participants randomized to intensive SBP control had greater risk of hypotension and possibly syncope , but not falls . 
The greater risk of developing these events associated with intensive treatment did not vary according to age . 
Low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis prevents a definitive stoma in patients with distal rectal cancer . 
However , imperative stool urge , stool fragmentation , prolonged stooling sessions , and minor problems of incontinence are frequently observed in the postoperative situation and negatively affect quality of life . 
Therefore , the colonic J-pouch was originally constructed to create a stool reservoir . 
In a randomized , prospective study , the short ( 5 cm ) colonic J-pouch was tested for function and continence vs. straight coloanal anastomosis . 
Over a period of 30 months , 74 consecutive patients ( 55 males ) with rectal cancer in the lower and middle third of the rectum were included and randomized into two groups . 
Anastomosis was performed either as a coloanal or a colon-pouch-anal anastomosis . 
The standardized surgical procedure included mobilization of the left hemicolon , central ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery and vein , preaortal lymph node dissection , autonomic nerve preservation , and total mesorectal excision . 
The anastomosis was performed at the upper anal canal or at the intersphincteric level . 
All patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively for fecal continence , including sphincter manometry and defecation habits . 
In addition , quality of life was determined by use of a standardized questionnaire ( European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer , EORTC-QLQ-C30 ) . 
Thirty-seven patients were randomized into each group . 
In general , problems with continence for liquids or gas occurred less frequently in the colonic J-pouch group 6 months after surgery . 
The frequency of bowel movements was lower in the J-pouch group ( 2.5 per day ) than in the coloanal group ( 4.7 per day ) . 
Importantly , in a manometric study at the same postoperative point , neorectal capacity was decreased to a similar degree in both groups compared with the preoperative rectal volume . 
Thus , the expected and postulated reservoir effect could not be achieved by forming a 5-cm colonic J-pouch . 
The colonic J-pouch was superior with regard to continence for gas and liquids compared with a straight coloanal anastomosis . 
Furthermore , stool frequency was significantly lower in the J-pouch group than in the coloanal reconstruction group . 
However , because neorectal capacity decreased equally in both groups , we speculate that the advantage of the colonic J-pouch is not in the creation of a larger neorectal reservoir but rather may be related to decreased motility . 
To observe the effect of the combined administration of entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil to improve hepatic fibrosis in hepatitis B patients with interferon resistance . 
This study comprised 90 hepatitis B patients with hepatic fibrosis and interferon ( IFN ) resistance who were admitted in the hospital 's department of infectious disease for diagnosis and treatment between January 2013 and September 2015 . 
They were randomly divided into two groups in accordance with the random number table : the combination treatment group ( N.=45 ) and the entecavir group ( N.=45 ) . 
They were observed for any variations in the indexes of liver function and fibrosis , as well as the Model for end-stage liver disease ( MELD ) scores , before and after treatment . 
After treatment , the levels of the indexes in both groups ( the combination treatment group vs. the entecavir group ) were as follows : bilirubin ( 67.5±7.7 vs. 82.4±13.5 μmol/L ) ; International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ( 1.21±0.8 vs. 1.14±0.7 ) ; creatinine ( 147.3±12.4 vs. 287.4±21.6 mg/dL ) ; GGT ( 67.4±23.2 vs. 88.4±23.7 U/L ) ; and ALT ( 63.4±40.8 vs. 96.5±23.5 U/L ) . 
In comparison of the indexes of hepatic fibrosis between the two groups , we found the following differences : PCIII ( 67.5±7.7 vs. 82.4±13.5 μg/L ) ; IV-C ( 61.3±18.7 vs. 74.5±17.9 μg/L ) ; HA ( 147.3±12.4 vs. 87.4±31.6 μg/L ) ; and LN ( 88.7±13.2 vs 102.5±23.4 μg/L ) . 
The results showed that the differences in comparison of the indexes before and after the treatment were statistically significant ( P < 0.05 ) . 
After treatment , the MELD score of patients in the combination treatment group was significantly lower than that in the entecavir group ( 18.7±3.2 vs. 22.5±3.4 ) , with a statistically significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) . 
In the chronic hepatitis B patients with interferon resistance , the combined administration of entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil can significantly improve liver function , hepatic fibrosis and MELD scores . 
The results highlight the need to promote the benefits of this drug combination in helping chronic hepatitis B patients with interferon resistance , and to promote its application in clinical practices . 
In China , the clinical management of chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) is complicated by the use of various nucleos ( t ) ide analogue ( NUC ) regimens in treatment-naïve patients , including NUCs with low genetic barriers to resistance , with/without add-on therapy and de novo NUC combinations . 
This longitudinal observational study therefore investigated the real-world clinical management and efficacy of NUC therapy in treatment-naïve CHB patients in China . 
Treatment-naïve CHB patients initiated on NUC therapy were enrolled from 63 hospitals in tier-2 Chinese cities . 
Demographic and treatment-specific data were collected , with the objective of reporting real-world treatment patterns and comparing the effectiveness of entecavir ( ETV ) treatment and lamivudine ( LAM ) -based treatment . 
We herein report the first-year data . 
3,408 NUC-naïve patients were enrolled and treated with NUCs ( 53 % ETV , 18 % LAM-based , 29 % other ) . 
Overall , 6.6 % of patients modified their initial treatment , with ETV having lower rates of treatment modification than other major NUCs ( P < 0.05 ) . 
At week 52 , the virologic response rate was higher with ETV than with LAM-based treatment ( 77.0 % versus 61.4 % , P < 0.0001 ) . 
LAM-based treatment was associated with a higher probability of virologic breakthrough and genotypic resistance ( 21.4 % and 19.6 % , respectively ) than ETV ( 1.6 % and 0.1 % , respectively ) ( P < 0.0001 ) . 
Treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events were uncommon . 
In this nationwide observational study , more than 50 % of patients with CHB in tier-2 city hospitals in China initially received ETV therapy . 
Consistent with clinical trial results , ETV was more effective than LAM-based treatments in a real-world setting , with treatment modification being relatively low in ETV-treated patients . 
To compare the postoperative intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and incidence of early complications after trabeculectomy with releasable suture to standard trabeculectomy in Chinese patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma . 
One hundred seventy-five patients diagnosed as primary angle-closure glaucoma with 6 clock-hours or more of peripheral anterior synechia were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups : 87 underwent standard trabeculectomy ( S group : 2 interrupted permanent sutures to the scleral flap ) and 88 received trabeculectomy with 2 permanent and 2 releasable sutures ( R group ) . 
The postoperative IOP and complications during the first 3 months after surgery were compared . 
One hundred seventy-one patients ( 97.7 % ) attended the 3-month visit . 
The IOP in the first week after trabeculectomy was significantly higher in the R group : day 1 , 17.3 ± 8.6 versus 12.7 ± 6.0 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) ; day 3 , 18.0 ± 7.3 versus 12.9 ± 6.3 mm Hg ( P < 0.001 ) ; day 7 , 14.8 ± 6.3 versus 12.0 ± 4.9 mm Hg ( P=0.001 ) , but no difference was observed after the second week ( P=0.659 to 0.753 ) . 
The incidence of transient hypotony was higher in S group ( 20.4 % ) than the R group ( 9.1 % ) ( P=0.046 ) ; hypotony recovered in 80.8 % ( 21/26 ) within 1 week . 
There was no difference in the occurrence of shallow chamber , choroidal detachment , macular edema , additional surgery , or hyphema ( P=0.56 to 1.0 ) . 
The technique of releasable sutures for trabeculectomy used in this study did not demonstrate significant advantages over standard trabeculectomy . 
Releasable sutures were associated with some decrease in visual acuity and increase in postoperative complaints . 
This study aimed to observe and compare the efficacy and safety of the combined therapy and two different optimized therapies of lamivudine ( LAM ) and adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) , as well as entecavir ( ETV ) monotherapy in patients with hepatitis B-induced decompensated cirrhosis . 
A total of 127 patients with decompensated cirrhosis were divided into four groups , and each group received different doses of regimens : initial combination of LAM and ADV , ADV add-on therapies with previous 12-week LAM , ADV add-on therapies with previous 24-week LAM , and ETV monotherapy . 
At the end of the treatment , the level of alanine amino-transferase ( ALT ) , albumin ( ALB ) and total bilirubin ( TBIL ) in the combination therapy group and 12-week optimized therapy group were significantly improved . 
For the 24-week optimized therapy group , only ALT levels revealed a significant improvement . 
There were no obvious differences in the normalization rate of ALT , negative conversion rate of HBV DNA and HBeAg , as well as improvement in Child-Pugh scores among the combination therapy group , 12-week optimized therapy group , and ETV monotherapy group . 
However , the difference among these three groups and the 24-week optimized therapy group were significant . 
Differences were not observed in the HBeAg seroconversion between each group . 
Differences in blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine , creatine kinase , or other serious adverse effects were not observed in each group at the end of the 96-week treatment . 
Combination therapy and early ADV addition were the preferred approaches in the antiviral strategy for the treatment of hepatitis B-induced decompensated cirrhosis . 
We aimed to compare a combined oral contraceptive ( COC ) plus the antiandrogen spironolactone with the insulin sensitizer metformin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . 
We conducted a randomized , parallel , open-label , clinical trial comparing COC ( 30 μg of ethinylestradiol and 150 μg of desogestrel ) plus spironolactone ( 100 mg/day ) with metformin ( 850 mg b.i.d . ) 
for one year in women with PCOS ( EudraCT2008-004531-38 ) . 
The composite primary outcome included efficacy ( amelioration of hirsutism , androgen excess and menstrual dysfunction ) and cardiometabolic safety ( changes in the frequencies of disorders of glucose tolerance , dyslipidemia and hypertension ) . 
A complete anthropometric , biochemical , hormonal and metabolic evaluation was conducted every three months and data were submitted to intention-to-treat analyses . 
Twenty-four patients were assigned to COC plus spironolactone and 22 patients to metformin . 
Compared with metformin , COC plus spironolactone caused larger decreases in hirsutism score ( mean difference 4.6 points , 95 % CI : 2.6-6.7 ) , total testosterone ( 1.1 nmol/L , 0.4-1.7 ) , free testosterone ( 25 pmol/L , 12-39 ) , androstenedione ( 5.5 nmol/L , 1.8-9.2 ) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate ( 2.7 μmol/L , 1.4-4.0 ) . 
Menstrual dysfunction was less frequent with COC plus spironolactone ( OR : 0.06 , 95 % CI : 0.02-0.23 ) . 
No differences were found in frequencies of abnormal glucose tolerance ( OR : 1.7 , 95 % CI : 0.7-4.4 ) , dyslipidemia ( OR : 0.6 , 95 % CI : 0.2-1.8 ) or hypertension ( OR : 0.3 , 95 % CI : 0.5-2.0 ) . 
No major adverse events occurred and biochemical markers were similarly safe with both treatments . 
COC plus spironolactone was more effective than metformin for symptoms of PCOS showing similar safety and overall neutral effects on cardiometabolic risk factors . 
To investigate the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin ( epoetin beta ) on anemia , transfusion need , and quality of life ( QOL ) in severely anemic patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , or multiple myeloma ( MM ) . 
Transfusion-dependent patients with NHL ( n = 106 ) , CLL ( n = 126 ) , or MM ( n = 117 ) and a low serum erythropoietin concentration were randomized to receive epoetin beta 150 IU/kg or placebo subcutaneously three times a week for 16 weeks . 
Primary efficacy criteria were transfusion-free and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival ( hemoglobin [ Hb ] > 8.5 g/dL ) between weeks 5 to 16 . 
Response was defined as an increase in Hb > or = 2 g/dL with elimination of transfusion need . 
QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale . 
Transfusion-free ( P =.0012 ) survival and transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival ( P =.0001 ) were significantly greater in the epoetin beta group versus placebo ( Wald chi ( 2 ) test ) , giving a relative risk reduction of 43 % and 51 % , respectively . 
The response rate was 67 % and 27 % in the epoetin beta versus the placebo group , respectively ( P < .0001 ) . 
After 12 and 16 weeks of treatment , QOL significantly improved in the epoetin beta group compared with placebo ( P < .05 ) ; this improvement correlated with an increase in Hb concentration ( > or = 2 g/dL ) . 
A target Hb that could be generally recommended could not be identified . 
Many severely anemic and transfusion-dependent patients with advanced MM , NHL , and CLL and a low performance status benefited from epoetin therapy , with elimination of severe anemia and transfusion need , and improvement in QOL . 
Efficacy of sequential therapy with nucleos ( t ) ide analogues and interferons versus monotherapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) -positive chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) remains unexplored . 
We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with adefovir ( ADV ) or entecavir ( ETV ) followed by peginterferon ( PEG-IFN ) alfa-2a in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive . 
This randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial was conducted at nine sites in Taiwan from April 2010 to October 2013 . 
Patients ( N = 280 ) were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo , ETV or ADV alone for four weeks , combined with PEG-IFN alfa-2a for two weeks , then PEG-IFN alfa-2a alone for 46 weeks . 
The primary efficacy end point was HBeAg seroconversion at 48 weeks post-treatment . 
No significant differences were observed among groups for HBeAg seroconversion ( PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo , 36.3 % ; PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV , 29.5 % ; and PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV , 27.4 % ) , HBeAg loss ( 37.4 % , 32.2 % , and 28.6 % , respectively ) or change in hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) levels from baseline ( -0.56 IU/mL , -0.60 IU/mL , and -0.41 IU/mL , respectively ) . 
However , hepatitis B virus DNA levels were higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa+ETV at week 64 ( p = 0.0412 ) , 76 ( p = 0.0311 ) , and 88 ( p = 0.0113 ) , and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) normalization rate was higher with PEG-IFN alfa-2a+placebo than PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ADV ( p = 0.0283 ) or PEG-IFN alfa-2a+ETV ( p = 0.0369 ) at week 88 . 
Sub-analysis of results revealed an association between on-treatment HBsAg and ALT levels and efficacy 48 weeks post-treatment . 
Safety was comparable among treatment groups . 
Pre-therapy with ADV or ETV followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a is not superior to PEG-IFN alfa-2a monotherapy in Taiwanese patients with HBeAg-positive CHB . 
To assess comparatively , in terms of quality-adjusted survival , three front-line treatments in patients with stage B- or C-chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . 
To describe better and compare the survival after randomization of patients from the CLL90 trial that randomly compared ChOP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , oncovin , prednisone ) , CAP ( cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , prednisone ) and fludarabine in advanced CLL , we performed a quality-adjusted survival analysis . 
This consisted of defining four clinical states ( toxicity , treatment free of toxicity , no treatment nor symptoms , relapse ) , then summing up the average times spent in each state weighted by utility coefficients that reflect relative value according to quality of life . 
The resulting quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity ( Q-TWIST ) was compared between randomized groups , and sensitivity ( threshold ) analyses to the choice of utility coefficients was performed . 
Over 73 months after randomization , the fludarabine group gained a mean of 45 days of toxicity-free survival at CAP , and 61 days over ChOP . 
The mean TWIST was 27.05 months with CAP , 31.5 months with ChOP and 32.95 months with fludarabine . 
The threshold analyses showed that , whatever the utility weights , the mean Q-TWIST was always greater with ChOP or fludarabine as compared to CAP . 
Fludarabine was consistently a better treatment than ChOP , except in the unlikely case of high utility weights attributed to toxicity and low utility weights attributed to treatment . 
Nevertheless , from a clinical point of view , differences between ChOP and fludarabine were moderate or event slight ( mean difference in TWIST of 1.45 months ) . 
We conclude that patients with advanced CLL have a moderate benefit in terms of Q-TWIST when treated with fludarabine over ChOP . 
These two treatments are always superior to CAP . 
To compare the efficacy of bimatoprost/timolol ( BTFC ) or travoprost/timolol ( TTFC ) fixed combinations on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction in an Egyptian population . 
Patients with primary open angle glaucoma were randomized to receive either BTFC or TTFC . 
IOPs were measured at baseline , 2 weeks , and 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 months . 
The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP from baseline at each visit . 
Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events . 
Eighty patients ( 80 eyes ) were included finally : 40 eyes in each group . 
Baseline mean IOPs were 24.78±3.53 and 25.26±3.51 mm Hg for BTFC and TTFC , respectively ( P=0.344 ) . 
Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits ( P < 0.001 ) . 
BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Mean IOP reductions were 11.34 and 6.42 mm Hg at 2 weeks ( P=0.000 ) , and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at 6 months ( P=0.001 ) for BTFC and TTFC , respectively . 
IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 36 ( 90.8 % ) versus 22 ( 55 % ) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 28 ( 70 % ) versus 16 ( 40 % ) eyes ( P < 0.001 ) , and at 6 months , 18 mm Hg in 38 ( 95 % ) versus 28 ( 70 % ) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 30 ( 75 % ) versus 18 ( 45 % ) eyes for BTFC and TTFC , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Both drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC . 
Despite the lack of evidence , a growing number of people are using herbal medicine to attenuate the burden of diabetes . 
There is an urgent need to investigate the clinical potential of herbs . 
Preliminary observations suggest that American ginseng ( Panax quinquefolius [ AG ] ) may reduce postprandial glycemia . 
Thus , we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AG as an add-on therapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) controlled by conventional treatment . 
24 individuals living with T2DM completed the study ( F : M = 11:13 ; age = 64 ± 7 year ; BMI = 27.8 ± 4.6 kg/m2 ; HbA1c = 7.1 ± 1.2 % ) . 
Utilizing a double-blind , cross-over design , the participants were randomized to receive either 1 g/meal ( 3 g/day ) of AG extract or placebo for 8 weeks while maintaining their original treatment . 
Following a ≥ 4-week washout period , the participants were crossed over to the opposite 8-week treatment arm . 
The primary objective was HbA1c , and secondary endpoints included fasting blood glucose and insulin , blood pressure , plasma lipids , serum nitrates/nitrites ( NOx ) , and plasominogen-activating factor-1 ( PAI-1 ) . 
Safety parameters included liver and kidney function . 
Compared to placebo , AG significantly reduced HbA1c ( - 0.29 % ; p = 0.041 ) and fasting blood glucose ( - 0.71 mmol/L ; p = 0.008 ) . 
Furthermore , AG lowered systolic blood pressure ( - 5.6 ± 2.7 mmHg ; p < 0.001 ) , increased NOx ( + 1.85 ± 2.13 µmol/L ; p < 0.03 ) , and produced a mean percent end-difference of - 12.3 ± 3.9 % in LDL-C and - 13.9 ± 5.8 % in LDL-C/HDL . 
The safety profiles were unaffected . 
AG extract added to conventional treatment provided an effective and safe adjunct in the management of T2DM . 
Larger studies using physiologically standardized ginseng preparations are warranted to substantiate the present findings and to demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness of AG . 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a slow-release formulation of cytarabine ( DepoCyt ; Chiron Corp , Emeryville , CA , and Skye Pharma , Inc , San Diego , CA ) that maintains cytotoxic concentrations of cytarabine ( ara-C ) in the CSF of most patients for more than 14 days . 
Twenty-eight patients with lymphoma and a positive CSF cytology were randomized to receive DepoCyt 50 mg once every 2 weeks or free ara-C 50 mg twice a week for 1 month . 
Patients whose CSF cytology converted to negative and who did not have neurologic progression received an additional 3 months of consolidation therapy and then 4 months of maintenance therapy . 
All patients received dexamethasone 4 mg orally bid on days 1 through 5 of each 2-week cycle . 
The response rate was 71 % for DepoCyt and 15 % for ara-C on an intent-to-treat basis ( P =.006 ) . 
All of the patients on the DepoCyt arm but only 53 % of those on the ara-C arm were able to complete the planned 1-month induction therapy regimen . 
Time to neurologic progression and survival trend in favor of DepoCyt ( median , 78.5 v 42 days and 99.5 v 63 days , respectively ; P > .05 ) . 
DepoCyt treatment was associated with an improved mean change in Karnofsky performance score at the end of induction ( P =.041 ) . 
The major adverse events on both arms were headache and arachnoiditis , which were often caused by the underlying disease . 
DepoCyt injected once every 2 weeks produced a high response rate and a better quality of life as measured by Karnofsky score relative to that produced by free ara-C injected twice a week . 
The aim of this 2-group , parallel , double blind single-centre RCT was to evaluate the acute and chronic impacts of high flavanol high theobromine ( HFHT ) chocolate consumption on endothelial function , arterial stiffness and blood pressure ( BP ) in women at risk of preeclampsia . 
131 pregnant women considered at risk of preeclampsia based on uterine artery Doppler ultrasound were divided into two groups ( HFHT or low flavanol and theobromine chocolate ( LFLT ) . 
Acute changes in plasma flavanol and theobromine , peripheral arterial tonometry and BP were evaluated at randomization ( 0 , 60 and 120 min after a single 40-g dose of chocolate ) and again 6 and 12 weeks after daily 30-g chocolate intake . 
The EndoPAT 2000 provided reactive hyperemia index ( RHI ) and adjusted augmentation index ( AIx ) as markers for endothelial function and arterial stiffness , respectively . 
Compared with LFLT , acute HFHT intake significantly increased plasma epicatechin and theobromine ( p < 0.0001 ) , decreased AIx ( p < 0.0001 ) and increased diastolic BP ( 3.49 ± 3.40 mmHg increase in HFHT group vs 1.55 ± 2.59 mmHg increase in LFLT group , p = 0.0008 ) . 
Chronic HFHT compared with LFLT intake significantly increased plasma theobromine ( p < 0.0001 ) . 
No other significant within group or between group changes were observed . 
Acute consumption of HFHT , compared to LFLT , increased plasma epicatechin and theobromine concentrations and decreased arterial stiffness , with no effect on endothelial function and a marginal increase in diastolic BP . 
Chronic HFHT intake increased plasma theobromine , though it did not have positive impacts on endothelial function , arterial stiffness or BP when compared to LFLT in pregnant women at risk of PE . 
The authors tested the hypothesis that a valsartan/cilnidipine combination would suppress the home morning blood pressure ( BP ) surge ( HMBPS ) more effectively than a valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination in patients with morning hypertension , defined as systolic BP ( SBP ) ≥135 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥85 mm Hg assessed by a self-measuring information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring device more than three times before either combination 's administration . 
This was an 8-week prospective , multicenter , randomized , open-label clinical trial . 
The HMBPS , which is a new index , was defined as the mean morning SBP minus the mean nocturnal SBP , both measured on the same day . 
The authors randomly allocated 129 patients to the valsartan/cilnidipine ( 63 patients ; mean 68.4 years ) or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide ( 66 patients ; mean 67.3 years ) combination groups , and the baseline HMBPS values were 17.4 mm Hg vs 16.9 mm Hg , respectively ( P = .820 ) . 
At the end of the treatment period , the changes in nocturnal SBP and morning SBP from baseline were significant in both the valsartan/cilnidipine and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide groups ( P < .001 ) : -5.0 vs -10.0 mm Hg ( P = .035 ) and -10.7 vs -13.6 mm Hg ( P = .142 ) , respectively . 
HMBPS was significantly decreased from baseline in both groups ( P < .001 ) , but there was no significant difference between the two groups : 14.4 mm Hg vs 14.0 mm Hg , respectively ( P = .892 ) . 
Valsartan/cilnidipine could not significantly suppress HMBPS compared with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide . 
Large-scale randomized controlled studies are needed to assess how reducing HMBPS will affect future cardiovascular outcomes . 
The information and communication technology-based home BP monitoring device may become an alternative to ambulatory BP monitoring , which has been a gold standard to measure nocturnal BP and the morning BP surge . 
To report 1-year treatment outcomes in the Primary Tube Versus Trabeculectomy ( PTVT ) Study . 
Two hundred forty-two eyes of 242 patients with medically uncontrolled glaucoma and no previous incisional ocular surgery , including 125 in the tube group and 117 in the trabeculectomy group . 
Patients were enrolled at 16 clinical centers and assigned randomly to treatment with a tube shunt ( 350-mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implant ) or trabeculectomy with mitomycin C ( MMC ; 0.4 mg/ml for 2 minutes ) . 
Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , glaucoma medical therapy , visual acuity , visual fields , surgical complications , and failure ( IOP of more than 21 mmHg or reduced by less than 20 % from baseline , IOP of 5 mmHg or less , reoperation for glaucoma , or loss of light perception vision ) . 
The cumulative probability of failure during the first year of follow-up was 17.3 % in the tube group and 7.9 % in the trabeculectomy group ( P = 0.01 ; hazard ratio , 2.59 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.20-5.60 ) . 
Mean ± standard deviation IOP was 13.8±4.1 mmHg in the tube group and 12.4±4.4 mmHg in the trabeculectomy group at 1 year ( P = 0.01 ) , and the number of glaucoma medications was 2.1±1.4 in the tube group and 0.9±1.4 in the trabeculectomy group ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Postoperative complications developed in 36 patients ( 29 % ) in the tube group and 48 patients ( 41 % ) in the trabeculectomy group ( P = 0.06 ) . 
Serious complications requiring reoperation or producing a loss of 2 Snellen lines or more occurred in 1 patient ( 1 % ) in the tube group and 8 patients ( 7 % ) in the trabeculectomy group ( P = 0.03 ) . 
Trabeculectomy with MMC had a higher surgical success rate than tube shunt implantation after 1 year in the PTVT Study . 
Lower IOP with use of fewer glaucoma medications was achieved after trabeculectomy with MMC compared with tube shunt surgery during the first year of follow-up . 
The frequency of serious complications producing vision loss or requiring reoperation was lower after tube shunt surgery relative to trabeculectomy with MMC . 
For several decades , both preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy and preoperative irradiation have been accepted treatments for patients with tumors of the head and neck . 
Unfortunately , arguments have often been put forward in favor of one or other of the two methods , but without the performance of an objective , randomized investigation . 
To resolve this situation , the authors have carried out a multicenter , randomized prospective study of selected patients with a view to deciding which method affords better results in complex tumor therapy from the aspects of survival and postoperative quality of life . 
One hundred thirty-one patients with operable sublingual or lingual squamous cell carcinoma in stages T2NXM0 to T4MXM0 were randomized into 2 groups : 1 group participated in preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and epirubicin ( total doses : 200 mg cisplatin , 120 mg epirubicin ) via the external carotid artery , whereas the other group received preoperative radiation therapy ( 46 grays ) . 
Following subsequent radical surgery , the patients received regular follow-up for 5 years . 
By the end of the 5 years , 95 of the 131 patients had conformed to the protocol . 
Of those 95 , 47 had received preoperative chemotherapy and 48 preoperative irradiation . 
After 5 years , 18 of the 47 patients who received chemotherapy and 15 of the 48 patients who received irradiation were still alive and tumor free . 
A few more patients had died of recurrence or regional metastasis in the chemotherapy group ( 23 patients ) than in the irradiation group ( 20 patients ) . 
Occurrence of a second carcinoma was 3 times as frequent in the irradiation group ( 9 patients ) as in the chemotherapy group ( 3 patients ) . 
Overall , the survival rates were by-and-large the same for the two groups . 
Regarding postoperative quality of life , the chemotherapy group presented a more favorable picture . 
The long term survival results subsequent to preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy or preoperative radiotherapy were practically the same . 
Regarding postoperative quality of life , patients who underwent intra-arterial chemotherapy appeared to be in a slightly more favorable situation . 
The authors consider it important to stress these findings , as they are not aware of a similar randomized study of patients with tumors of the oral cavity . 
Vesatolimod ( GS-9620 ) is an oral agonist of toll-like receptor 7 , an activator of innate and adaptive immune responses . 
Herein the safety and efficacy of vesatolimod is assessed after once-weekly treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) infection suppressed on oral antiviral treatment . 
In a phase II , double-blind , randomized , placebo ( PBO ) -controlled study , 162 patients stratified by hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) levels and serum hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) status were randomized 1:3:3:3 to once-weekly oral PBO or vesatolimod ( 1- , 2- , or 4-mg doses ) for 4 , 8 or 12 weeks per cohort . 
Efficacy was assessed by change in baseline HBsAg ( log10 IU/ml ) at the primary endpoint ( Week 24 ) . 
Safety assessments included adverse events ( AE ) and laboratory abnormality monitoring . 
Pharmacodynamic assessments included peripheral cytokine level quantification and interferon-stimulated gene ( ISG ) mRNA expression evaluation . 
The majority of patients were male ( 76 % ) and HBeAg-negative ( 79 % ) at baseline . 
Most ( 41-80 % ) experienced ≥1 AE during the study with the majority of AEs mild or moderate in severity . 
No significant declines in HBsAg were observed at the primary ( Week 24 ) or secondary endpoints ( Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , and 48 ) . 
ISG15 induction was dose-dependent and consistent after repeat dosing , returning closer to baseline by one week after treatment at all dose levels ; no patient demonstrated significant serum interferon alpha ( IFNα ) expression at any timepoint evaluated . 
Multivariate analyses showed that ≥2-fold ISG15 induction is associated with 2- or 4-mg vesatolimod dose and female sex . 
Vesatolimod was safe and well-tolerated in patients with CHB , demonstrating consistent dose-dependent pharmacodynamic induction of ISG15 without significant systemic induction of IFNα expression or related symptoms . 
However , no significant HBsAg declines were observed . 
The potential protective effects of remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) on contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) remain to be defined . 
A double blind , randomized , placebo controlled multicenter study was performed . 
Patients younger than 85years old , with a renal clearance of 30-60ml/min/1.73m2 , who were candidates for PCI for all clinical indications except for primary PCI , were allocated 1:1 to RIPC or to standard therapy . 
The primary endpoint was incidence of CIN . 
The secondary endpoint was incidence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction ( PMI ) . 
From February 2013 to April 2014 , 3108 patients who were scheduled for coronary angiography were screened for the study . 
442 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 223 received PCI . 
These patients were randomized to sham RIPC ( n=107 ) or treatment group ( n=116 ) . 
The only pre-specified subgroup of diabetic patients included 85 ( 38 % ) cases . 
RIPC significantly reduced CIN incidence in the overall population ( 12.1 % vs. 26.1 % , p=0.01 , with a NNT=9 ) and in non-diabetic patients ( 9.2 % vs. 25.0 % , p=0.02 ) , but showed no benefit in diabetics ( 16.7 % vs. 28.2 % , p=0.21 ) . 
A trend for lower PMI was seen in the intervention arm ( creatine kinase - muscle brain > 5 URL ; 8.4 % vs. 16.4 % , p=0.07 ; troponin T > 5 URL ; 27 % vs. 38 % , p=0.21 ) . 
Remote ischemic preconditioning significantly reduces the incidence of acute kidney injury in non-diabetic patients undergoing PCI . 
Larger sample size is presumably needed to assess the effect of RIPC for patients with diabetes mellitus . 
Hypertension is a generally accepted atherogenic risk factor . 
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate changes in carotid intima-media thickness ( c-IMT ) and explore the association of cardiovascular risk factors and the carotid intima thickness in adults with hypertension using standardized methods . 
We used data from a subgroup of Beijing Vascular Disease Patients Evaluation Study ( BEST ) , a population-based study of community-dwelling adults . 
The c-IMT , biomarkers , and carotid-femoral-pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) were measured at baseline , and lifestyles such as smoking status , sleeping habits , and oil or salt intake level were determined with the use of a validated questionnaire in the follow-up . 
We reevaluated c-IMT in all the initial 1284 ( 540 female and 744 male ) patients with hypertension after 4 years . 
At reevaluation , mean ( ± SD ) age was 66 ± 1.2 years , systolic blood pressure was 138 ± 19 mmHg , and diastolic blood pressure was 91 ± 10 mmHg . 
The results showed that mean c-IMT z-scores increased significantly during 4 years ( 0.002 ± 0.003 , p < 0.001 ) as well as carotid-femoral PWV ( 13.99 ± 2.74 , p < 0.01 ) and total cholesterol ( 6.97 ± 1.08 , p < 0.001 ) . 
Linear regression showed statistically significant associations between systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , C-reactive protein , lip-line , and heart rate with c-IMT z-scores of > 1.5SD in the fully adjusted models and the p values were 0.000 , 0.000 , 0.017 , 0.001 , and 0.044 , respectively . 
There were significant predictors for the mean effect on c-IMT z-score . 
In a full-model logistic regression , significant risk factors for an increase in IMT of ≥1.5 z-scores were carotid-femoral PWV ( odds ratio : 1.119 , confidence interval : 1.018 , 1.230 , p = 0.020 < 0.05 ) at first measurement . 
The conclusion of the study was that longitudinal c-IMT measurements revealed progression in subclinical atherosclerosis during a four-year period in a hypertensive old-aged cohort . 
Systolic or diastolic blood pressure , homocysteine , carotid-femoral PWV , and waistline were significantly related to c-IMT increment . 
By lifestyle and medical intervention to control these risk factors may prevent progression of c-IMT in old-aged cohort with hypertension . 
The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin may influence insulin sensitivity in insulin-responsive tissues . 
This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of rapamycin pre-treatment before pancreatic islet allotransplantation ( ITx ) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . 
Forty-one T1DM patients were studied . 
Thirteen patients with poor glycemic control underwent a short-term rapamycin treatment before ITx ( Group 1 ) , and they were compared to 28 patients undergoing ITx without rapamycin pre-treatment ( Group 2 ) . 
Outcomes were daily insulin requirement ( DIR ) , fasting blood glucose , HbA1c , C-peptide and the SUITO index of beta-cell function . 
A subgroup of patients pre-treated with rapamycin before ITx underwent euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with [ 6,6-2H2 ] glucose before and after ITx to evaluate insulin sensitivity . 
We found a significant reduction in DIR after rapamycin pre-treatment ( - 8 ± 6 U/day , mean ± SD , p < 0.001 ) and 1 year after ITx . 
DIR reduction 1 year after ITx was greater in Group 1 as compared to Group 2 ( - 37 ± 15 vs. - 19 ± 13 U/day , p = 0.005 ) and remained significant after adjusting for gender , age , glucose and baseline HbA1c ( beta = 18.2 ± 5.9 , p = 0.006 ) . 
Fasting glucose and HbA1c significantly decreased 1 year after ITx in Group 1 ( HbA1c : - 2.1 ± 1.4 % , p = 0.002 ) , while fasting C-peptide ( +0.5 ± 0.3 nmol/l , p = 0.002 ) and SUITO index increased ( +57.4 ± 39.7 , p = 0.016 ) , without differences between the two groups . 
Hepatic glucose production decreased after rapamycin pre-treatment ( - 1.1 ± 1.1 mg/kg/min , p = 0.04 ) and after ITx ( - 1.6 ± 0.6 mg/kg/min , p = 0.015 ) , while no changes in peripheral glucose disposal were observed . 
Rapamycin pre-treatment before ITx succeeds in reducing insulin requirement , enhancing hepatic insulin sensitivity . 
This treatment may improve short-term ITx outcomes , possibly in selected patients with T1DM complicated by insulin resistance . 
The hepatitis B is most prevalent diseases ( along with morbidities ) in Asian countries . 
This research study has been conducted to provide an alternative treatment which is safe , effective and cost-effective to comprehend relations of disease , symptoms , patients response and the clinical response via better management of hepatitis B . 
The goal of this research is to evaluate efficacy and safety of herbal medicine as compared to allopathic medicine in patients suffering from hepatitis B . 
This was a single blind , randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at Shifa-ul-Mulk Memorial Hospital Hamdard University , Karachi and Dar ul Shifa Unani Dawakhana Karachi , Pakistan . 
The patients of both genders ranging from 25 to 50 years with symptoms and diagnosed for hepatitis B that fulfilled the criteria for membership , and consented for participation were registered . 
Ethical committee clearance and permission was obtained from the concerned committee at Faculty of Eastern Medicine , Hamdard University , Karachi , Pakistan . 
No significant difference was identified after treatment and it was found that the efficacy of Alpha ( Control drug ) is same as Safoof akseer e jigar ( Test drug ) . 
The data offered support to the null hypothesis and therefore research hypothesis was rejected . 
According to the statistical analysis by chi square , hepatitis B was recorded as negative in 26 patients ( 57.77 % ) out of 45 patients by the use of Interferon Alpha ( control therapy ) and in 27 patients ( 64.28 % ) out of 42 patients by the use of Safoof akseer e jigar ( test drug ) . 
Comparison of the data recorded of the patients was determined as both drugs showed significant improvement and p value > 0.05 . 
The efficacy response is equal in both drugs while test drug showed more safety response . 
It is concluded that Safoof akseer e jigar possesses as effective a therapeutic value in treating hepatitis B as allopathic medicine . 
Observational data support a role for vitamin D in type 2 diabetes , but evidence from trials is inconclusive . 
To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on β-cell function and hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes . 
Double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial . 
Tufts Medical Center , Boston , MA ; VA Medical Center , Cincinnati , OH . 
A total of 127 patients ( mean age , 60 years ) with stable ( HbA1c ≤7.5 % ) diabetes managed with lifestyle only or lifestyle plus metformin . 
Subjects were given 4000 units of vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) daily or placebo for 48 weeks . 
Insulin secretion rate ( ISR ) was estimated from peripheral plasma C-peptide levels after a 3-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test done at baseline and week 24 . 
Changes in HbA1c were assessed at 16 , 24 , 36 , and 48 weeks . 
Baseline mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] concentration was 26.6 ng/mL , mean HbA1c was 6.6 % , and 78 % of patients were on metformin . 
At week 24 , mean 25 ( OH ) D changed by 20.5 and -1.6 ng/mL in the vitamin D and placebo groups , respectively ( P < 0.001 ) . 
The vitamin D and placebo groups did not differ in change in ISR or HbA1c . 
Among patients treated with lifestyle only ( n = 28 ) , vitamin D supplementation reduced HbA1c compared with placebo ( -0.1 % vs 0.3 % , respectively ; P = 0.034 ) at week 24 . 
This result was not observed at the other time points and could be due to chance . 
Vitamin D3 at 4000 IU/d did not change ISR or HbA1c in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes on metformin not selected for vitamin D deficiency . 
To compare the outcomes of microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy to standard rigid probe trabeculotomy in childhood glaucomas . 
Eyes of children requiring trabeculotomy for primary congenital or secondary paediatric glaucoma were randomized to undergo either trabeculotomy using the Glaucolight illuminated microcatheter , or a rigid probe trabeculotomy . 
Complete success was defined as an intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of < 18 mmHg without medications . 
A total of 62 eyes of 62 patients were included . 
Of these 30 eyes of 30 patients aged 5.6 ± 4.8 months underwent microcatheter-assisted trabeculotomy , with 15 eyes ( 50 % ) having a complete 360° cut , while 15 eyes ( 50 % ) had an incomplete cut ranging from 250 to 350 degrees . 
The rigid probe trabeculotomy group included 32 eyes of 32 patients aged 4.4 ± 3.8 months . 
At the end of the 2-year follow-up period , the complete success and the failure rates were 67 % and 15 % , respectively , in the microcatheter-assisted group versus 47 % and 50 % in the rigid probe trabeculotomy group ( p = 0.006 ) . 
There was a tendency towards lower IOP in the microcatheter group at 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 months postoperatively , with the difference in IOP reaching statistical significance at 6 months ( p = 0.004 ) . 
The mean survival time was significantly longer for the microcatheter group ( p = 0.01 ) . 
At 2 years postoperatively , microcatheter-assisted trabeculotomy still yielded superior results in terms of IOP control and success rates in children with primary congenital glaucoma . 
The need for reoperation for glaucoma was significantly lower in the microcatheter group . 
Cardiovascular complications are one of main cause of increased mortality and morbidity among Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) patients . 
Altered metabolism of sulphur amino acids in diabetes reflected as increases in concentration of methionine and cysteine/cystine in the blood which known as a markers of Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD ) . 
The aim of present study was to determine the effect of Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) supplementation on sulfhydryl amino acids and Atherogenic Index of Plasma ( AIP ) in patients with type 2 DM ( T2DM ) . 
A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed in 36 control and patients with DM . 
The subjects were randomly assigned to obtain 2 g/d EPA ( n = 18 ) or placebo ( n = 18 ) for 8 weeks . 
Fasting serum level of Cystein and Methionine were measured using HPLC method and atherogenic index of plasma ( AIP ) as a proxy measure of atherosclerosis was computed . 
Eight weeks supplementation with EPA led to significant reductions in Met ( p < 0.002 ) and Cys ( p < 0.001 ) compared with the placebo ( p < 0.06 ) . 
In addition , compared to placebo a significant reduction in AIP were seen after taking EPA ( p < 0.04 ) . 
EPA supplementation in patients with T2DM for eight weeks had beneficial effects on Met , Cys and AIP , which may attribute to the prevention of vascular complications in the T2DM patients . 
The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery . 
Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease ( pT3/4 or pN+ ) . 
In recent years , encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported . 
This prospective randomized phase-III trial ( CAO/ARO/AIO-94 ) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy . 
We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity . 
Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer ( uT3/4 or uN+ , Mason CS III/IV ) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy : A total dose of 50.4 Gy ( single dose 1.8 Gy ) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes . 
5-FU ( 1,000 mg/m2/d ) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion . 
Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy ( 500 mg/m2/d , i.v . 
bolus ) were applied . 
Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting . 
Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms . 
Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision . 
In addition , stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for . 
Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival , local and distant control , secondary endpoints include rate of curative ( R0 ) resections and sphincter saving procedures , toxicity of radiochemotherapy , surgical complications and quality of life . 
As of 15th November 2000 , 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions : 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy , 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy . 
Acute toxicity ( WHO ) of radiochemotherapy was low , with less than 15 % of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity : The principal toxicity was diarrhea , with 12 % in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10 % in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3 , and 1 % in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea . 
Erythema , nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities , with less than 3 % of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea . 
Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms , with 12 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 13 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) of patients , respectively , suffering from anastomotic leakage , 4 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 3 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from postoperative bleeding , and 6 % ( postoperative radiochemotherapy ) and 5 % ( preoperative radiochemotherapy ) from delayed wound healing . 
The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory , neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity . 
Imatinib ( Gleevec ) , a highly effective specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor , demonstrates a better side effect profile than interferon-alpha ( IFN ) , which impairs patients ' quality of life ( QoL ) . 
This phase III international study evaluated QoL outcomes in 1,106 newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) who were randomized to receive either imatinib 400 mg daily or IFN up to 5 MU/m ( 2 ) /d with cytarabine ( Ara-C ) 20 mg/m ( 2 ) /d added for 10 days every month ( IFN + LDAC ) . 
Crossover to the other treatment arm was permitted due to a lack of efficacy or treatment intolerance . 
QoL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Biologic Response Modifiers ( FACT-BRM ) at baseline , monthly for 6 months and then at months 9 , 12 , and 18 . 
The Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ; a composite endpoint of physical/functional/treatment-specific subscales ) was the primary endpoint . 
Secondary endpoints measured were social/family well-being ( SFWB ) and emotional well-being ( EWB ) . 
QoL was analyzed for the first 18 months of treatment using mixed effects growth curve models . 
The primary analyses were intention-to-treat ( ITT ) ; secondary analyses incorporated crossover as a time-dependent covariate . 
A total of 1,049 patients completed at least one QoL assessment . 
Two hundred sixty-one patients ( 50 % ) crossed over from IFN to imatinib and 11 ( 2 % ) crossed over from imatinib to IFN . 
There was a significant decline in TOI scores for the IFN treatment arm compared with preservation of baseline TOI scores in the imatinib arm ( P < .001 , ITT ) . 
Mean social/family and EWB scores were 22.8 and 19.5 , respectively , for imatinib and 21.6 and 17.6 , respectively , for IFN ( P < .001 , ITT ) . 
After crossing over from IFN to imatinib , patients experienced a significant ( P < .001 ) increase in TOI scores . 
Imatinib offers clear QoL advantages over IFN as first-line treatment of chronic-phase CML . 
In addition , patients who crossed over to imatinib reported higher QoL than those who remained on IFN . 
Recently , there has been an increasing interest in the influence of antioxidant vitamins on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in type 2 diabetic patients ( T2DM ) . 
This single-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial aimed to investigate the effect of vitamin C and/or E supplementation on the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic therapy in T2DM Palestinian male patients from the Gaza Strip . 
Forty T2DM male patients aged 40-60 years on metformin treatment were randomly divided into four groups , each group received an additional one of the following daily oral supplements for 90 days : placebo ; vitamin C ; vitamin E and vitamin C plus vitamin E. After overnight fasting , venous blood specimens were collected from all individuals into K3-EDTA tubes and serum tubes for measuring the biochemical and hematological parameters of the study at baseline and after 90 days of vitamins supplementation . 
The results revealed that vitamin C and/or E improve fasting blood sugar ( FBS ) , HbA1c , lipid profile , insulin , homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , reduced glutathione ( GSH ) ; and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index ( QISCI ) compared with diabetic patients group that received placebo . 
This study provided additional evidence on the beneficial effects of supplementing antioxidant vitamins in T2DM which could improve the clinical condition and attenuate or prevent diabetic pathogenesis and complications that , secondly to poor glycemic control , could attribute to the imbalance between the decline in the endogenous antioxidants and increasing production of the reactive oxygen species leading to the oxidant-mediated damage present in the diabetic context . 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) can be associated with painful , pruritic , disfiguring lesions . 
As part of a multicenter , randomized phase III trial in patients with heavily pretreated advanced and/or recurrent CTCL , the effects of an interleukin-2 receptor-targeted fusion protein , denileukin diftitox ( DAB389IL-2 , ONTAK ) , on patient-rated overall quality of life ( QOL ) , skin appearance , and pruritus severity were evaluated . 
A total of 71 patients with stage IB-IVA CTCL received intravenous denileukin diftitox 9 microg/kg/day or 18 microg/kg/day over 15-60 minutes for 5 consecutive days on an outpatient basis ; cycles were planned for every 21 days for a total of 8 cycles over 6 months . 
Prior to each treatment cycle , patients were evaluated for disease response and were asked to self-rate their overall QOL via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) questionnaire , skin appearance ( 7-point scale ) , and pruritus severity ( 10-cm visual analogue scale ) . 
Composite FACT-G and most individual subscale scores ( physical , social/family , emotional , and functional well being ) in documented responders ( n = 21 ) gradually increased during the study period , generally reaching statistical significance ( P < 0.05 ) by cycle 3 , and were significantly ( P < or = 0.041 ) higher than the scores of nonresponders at endpoint . 
Additionally for responders , assessments of skin severity and pruritus severity showed significant ( P < or = 0.05 ) improvements at study endpoint compared with baseline . 
Adverse transfusion-related events ( eg , hypersensitivity reactions , flu-like syndrome ) were common during cycles 1 and 2 , and vascular-leak syndrome occurred in 25 % of patients . 
Denileukin diftitox was not associated with any clinically significant myelosuppression . 
Heavily pretreated patients with advanced and/or recurrent CTCL who responded to denileukin diftitox therapy showed significant improvements in self-rated overall QOL , skin appearance , and pruritus severity . 
The blood pressure-lowering effect of fermented milk with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 was evaluated in a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with prehypertensive subjects . 
Participants were randomized into 2 groups ( n = 18 each group ) : one group treated with fermented milk with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and a control group treated with artificially acidified milk . 
Results revealed that during daily consumption of fermented milk for 5 wk , systolic [ ( 116.55 ± 12.26 mmHg vs. 124.77 ± 11.04 mmHg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( 80.7 ± 9 vs. 84.5 ± 8.5 mmHg ) ] from the fermented milk group was lower than the control group . 
Additionally , triglyceride , total cholesterol , and low-density lipoprotein in blood serum were lower in the fermented milk group than in the control group . 
Results demonstrated that daily consumption of fermented milk with Lactococcus lactis ( NRRL B-50571 ) had a blood pressure-lowering effect on prehypertensive subjects . 
Regular consumption of this product may be used as a potential functional food . 
Antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) interruptions increase the risk of severe morbidity/mortality in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individuals from subSaharan Africa . 
We aimed to determine whether the risk is further increased among HIV-hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) co-infected patients in this setting . 
In this sub-analysis of a randomized-control trial , 632 participants from Côte d'Ivoire randomized to receive continuous-ART ( C-ART ) , structured ART interruptions of 2-months off , 4-months on ( 2/4-ART ) , and CD4-guided ART interruptions ( CD4GT , interruption at 350/mm3 and reintroduction at 250/mm3 ) were analyzed . 
Incidence rates ( IR ) of serious HIV- and non-HIV-related morbidity were compared between patients stratified on hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) status . 
Overall , 65 ( 10.3 % ) were HBsAg-positive , 29 ( 44.6 % ) of whom had HBV-DNA levels > 10,000 copies/mL . 
After a median 2.0 year ( range = 0.2-3.1 ) follow-up , ≥ 1 serious HIV-related events occurred in 101 HIV mono-infected and 15 HIV-HBV co-infected patients ( IR = 10.0 versus 13.2/100 person/years , respectively , P = 0.3 ) , whereas the highest incidence was observed in co-infected patients with baseline HBV-replication > 10,000 copies/mL ( IR = 24.0/100 person/years , P versus HIV mono-infected = 0.002 ) . 
Incidence of bacterial infections was also highest in the co-infected group with HBV-replication > 10,000 copies/mL ( IR = 12.9 versus 3.3/100 person/years in HIV mono-infected patients , P = 0.001 ) . 
The relative effect of CD4GT or 2/4-ART versus C-ART was not different between infection groups ( P for interaction = 0.4 ) . 
No increase in the incidence of non-HIV-related morbidity was observed for co-infected patients ( P = 0.5 ) , even at HBV-replication levels > 10,000 copies/mL ( P = 0.7 ) . 
In conclusion , co-infected patients with elevated HBV-replication at ART-initiation are more susceptible to HIV-related morbidity , especially invasive bacterial diseases , during treatment interruption . 
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation in patients with resolved HBV infection ( HBsAg negative , antiHBc positive ) is uncommon , but potentially fatal . 
The role of HBV prophylaxis in this setting is uncertain . 
The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) prophylaxis versus close monitoring in antiHBc-positive , HBsAg-negative patients under treatment with rituximab ( RTX ) -based regimens for hematologic malignancy . 
PREBLIN is a phase IV , randomized , prospective , open-label , multicenter , parallel-group trial conducted in 17 hospitals throughout Spain . 
Anti-HBc-positive , HBsAg-negative patients with undetectable HBV DNA were randomized to receive TDF 300 mg once daily ( Group I ) or observation ( Group II ) . 
The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients showing HBV reactivation during 18 months following initiation of RTX treatment . 
Patients with detectable HBV DNA ( Group III ) received the same dose of TDF and were analyzed together with Group I to investigate TDF safety . 
Sixty-one patients were enrolled in the study , 33 in the TDF treatment group and 28 in the observation group . 
By ITT analysis , HBV reactivation was 0 % ( 0/33 ) in the study group and 10.7 % ( 3/28 ) in the observation group ( p = 0.091 ) . 
None of the patients in either group showed significant differences in liver function parameters between baseline and the last follow-up sample . 
TDF was generally well tolerated and there were no severe treatment-related adverse events . 
In patients with hematological malignancy and resolved hepatitis B infection receiving RTX-based regimens , HBV reactivation did not occur in patients given TDF prophylaxis . 
Chronic hepatitis B management is commonly targeted at reducing viral replication . 
However , the currently available antiviral therapies are associated with some problems , including resistance and numerous adverse effects . 
Ginseng has been reported to be effective for treating viral infections such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus . 
However , there are currently few studies on the effects of ginseng in chronic hepatitis B . 
Thus , this study investigated the effects of ginseng together with antiviral agents in chronic hepatitis B . 
This was a prospective , single-blinded , randomized controlled trial , and single-center study . 
Thirty-eight patients were enrolled . 
The control group ( n = 19 ) was administered antiviral agents alone . 
The experimental group ( n = 19 ) was administered antiviral agents along with Korean Red Ginseng powder capsules ( each dose is 1 gram ( two capsules ) , a one-day dose is 3 grams ) . 
The baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups . 
Differences in several non-invasive fibrosis serologic markers ( type IV collagen , hyaluronic acid , transforming growth factor-β ) and in the hepatitis B virus DNA levels were compared between the groups . 
The non-invasive fibrosis serologic markers were further decreased in the experimental group , with significant differences after treatment observed for hyaluronic acid ( p = 0.032 ) and transforming growth factor-β ( p = 0.008 ) , but not for type IV collagen ( p = 0.174 ) . 
This study suggests the possibility of Korean Red Ginseng as a complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis B . 
To evaluate the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2 % -timolol 0.5 % compared with latanoprost 0.005 % in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
This was a prospective , randomized , multicenter , investigator-masked clinical trial . 
After washout of any previous IOP-lowering medications , patients with IOP of 24 mmHg or higher were randomized to twice-daily fixed-combination brimonidine 0.2 % -timolol 0.5 % ( n = 73 ) or once-daily latanoprost 0.005 % ( n = 75 , dosed in the evening , with vehicle control in the morning to maintain masking ) for 12 weeks . 
IOP was measured at 8 a.m. ( before dosing ) , 10 a.m. , and 3 p.m. at baseline , week 6 , and week 12 . 
The primary efficacy endpoint was diurnal IOP ( averaged over 8 a.m. , 10 a.m. , and 3 p.m. ) at week 12 . 
Safety measures included biomicroscopy . 
There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups in mean diurnal IOP at baseline ( p = 0.118 ) . 
At week 12 , the mean ( SD ) diurnal IOP was 17.8 ( 2.9 ) mmHg with brimonidine-timolol and 17.9 ( 3.9 ) mmHg with latanoprost ( p = 0.794 ) . 
The percentage of patients achieving at least a 20 % decrease from baseline diurnal IOP at week 12 was 87.7 % in the brimonidine-timolol group and 77.3 % in the latanoprost group ( p = 0.131 ) . 
Measured biomicroscopic changes from baseline to week 12 were infrequent in both groups . 
Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol was as effective as latanoprost in reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension . 
Both treatments demonstrated favorable ocular tolerability . 
The duration of the study was 12 weeks , and additional studies will be needed to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol and latanoprost during long-term treatment . 
We compared the clinical effects and impact on quality of life ( QOL ) of patients who received a 3-month course of flutamide monotherapy before radical prostatectomy with those who received a 3-month course of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist monotherapy . 
Thirty-seven patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer were enrolled in this study ( 19 , flutamide ; 18 , LHRH agonist ) . 
The rates of change of serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) and testosterone levels , downsizing of prostate volume , the rate of organ confined disease , adverse effects and perioperative scores measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Prostate Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire ( EORTC-P ) and the Sapporo Medical University Sexual Function Questionnaire ( SMUF ) were analyzed . 
At radical prostatectomy , pathological variables were not significantly different in the two groups . 
Serum testosterone level was significantly higher ( mean 359.2 compared to 10.5 , P < 0.001 ) , complete response rate of PSA ( 13 % compared to 57 % , P = 0.028 ) and rate of downsizing of prostate volume ( mean , -17.7 % compared to -35.4 % , P = 0.038 ) were significantly lower in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group . 
After neoadjuvant hormone therapy , the scores on the sexual problem domain of EORTC-P ( P = 0.033 ) and sexual desire score of SMUF ( P = 0.021 ) were significantly higher in the flutamide group than in the LHRH group . 
At a median follow-up of 34 months after prostatectomy , biochemical failure-free survival rate in the flutamide group did not differ from that in the LHRH group . 
This study suggests that flutamide monotherapy can be an acceptable modality as an option for neoadjuvant hormone therapy . 
Increasing evidence suggests that iron-containing multiple micronutrient may reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension including gestational hypertension or preeclampsia . 
We aimed to examine whether 30 mg iron plus folic acid or multiple micronutrients during pregnancy reduces the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension . 
We conducted a secondary data analysis by the dataset from a double-blind randomized controlled trial in China from 2006 to 2009 that was conducted to investigate the effects of multiple micronutrient supplements on adverse pregnancy outcomes when provided to pregnant women with no/mild anemia . 
We used logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval and test for effect modification . 
The incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was 7.1 % ( 423/5923 ) , 6.3 % ( 374/5933 ) and 6.3 % ( 372/5914 ) among the pregnant women who took folic acid only , iron-folic acid and multiple micronutrient supplements , respectively . 
The adjusted odds ratios associated with iron-folic acid supplements and multiple micronutrient supplements for pregnancy-induced hypertension were both nearly 0.88 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.76-1.02 ) , compared with folic acid supplements only . 
Among pregnant women aged 20-24 years , iron-folic acid ( adjusted odds ratios : 0.81 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.67-0.96 ) or multiple micronutrient supplementation ( adjusted odds ratios : 0.83 , 95 % confidence interval : 0.70-0.99 ) can significantly reduce the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension compared to folic acid supplementation . 
Overall , there were no significant differences in pregnancy-induced hypertension across supplement groups . 
However , among pregnant women aged 20-24 years , iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension compared with folic acid supplements only . 
To investigate whether docetaxel plus platinum regimens improve survival and affect quality of life ( QoL ) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) compared with vinorelbine plus cisplatin as first-line chemotherapy . 
Patients ( n = 1,218 ) with stage IIIB to IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks ( DC ) ; docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under the curve of 6 mg/mL * min every 3 weeks ( DCb ) ; or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/wk and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 4 weeks ( VC ) . 
Patients treated with DC had a median survival of 11.3 v 10.1 months for VC-treated patients ( P =.044 ; hazard ratio , 1.183 [ 97.2 % confidence interval , 0.989 to 1.416 ] ) . 
The 2-year survival rate was 21 % for DC-treated patients and 14 % for VC-treated patients . 
Overall response rate was 31.6 % for DC-treated patients v 24.5 % for VC-treated patients ( P =.029 ) . 
Median survival ( 9.4 v 9.9 months [ for VC ] ; P =.657 ; hazard ratio , 1.048 [ 97.2 confidence interval , 0.877 to 1.253 ] ) and response ( 23.9 % ) with DCb were similar to those results for VC . 
Neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , infection , and febrile neutropenia were similar with all three regimens . 
Grade 3 to 4 anemia , nausea , and vomiting were more common ( P < .01 ) with VC than with DC or DCb . 
Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had consistently improved QoL compared with VC-treated patients , who experienced deterioration in QoL . 
DC resulted in a more favorable overall response and survival rate than VC . 
Both DC and DCb were better tolerated and provided patients with consistently improved QoL compared with VC . 
These findings demonstrate that a docetaxel plus platinum combination is an effective treatment option with a favorable therapeutic index for first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC . 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is a rare and life-threatening disease well-marked by under diagnosis , delayed diagnosis and atypical treatments . 
Few data are available on the quality of life ( QoL ) and psychosocial characteristics of patients with PAH . 
Our aim is to describe the impact of psychological factors on the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) of treated PAH patients in a cross-sectional study . 
Consecutive patients presenting at our Competency Centre for PAH were recruited . 
The aetiology , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) stage , haemodynamics , 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) , delta SPO2 ( Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation ; baseline lowest value during 6-min walk test ( 6MWT ) , current treatments and psychological history were recorded . 
HRQoL , anxiety , depression and coping strategies were explored using self-administered questionnaires ( SF-36 , HADS , STAI-Y , CHIP and WCC ) . 
A total of 55 patients were included . 
The HRQoL of PAH patients was poor with altered results on several scales . 
Anxiety and depression were high and coping was focused on medical information strategies . 
Multivariate analysis indicated a positive relationship between 6MWD and the Physical Composite Score for QoL ( p=0.004 ) , as well as a negative relationship between delta SPO2 and the Mental Composite Score ( p=0.02 ) , irrespective of other known prognostic factors ( such as haemodynamics at right heart catheterization ) . 
Depression and Trait-Anxiety were associated with a lower physical ( p=0.001 ) and mental ( p < 0.001 ) QoL , respectively . 
Psychological factors impact the HRQoL of treated patients . 
A longitudinal and qualitative study should refine these results . 
Data are insufficient regarding the survival benefit of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . 
To investigate the effectiveness of HCC surveillance in a hepatitis B-endemic population . 
This retrospective cohort study included 1402 consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed with HCC between 2005 and 2012 at a single tertiary hospital in Korea . 
The primary endpoint was overall survival . 
Lead-time and length-time biases were adjusted ( sojourn time = 140 days ) and sensitivity analyses were performed . 
The most common aetiology was hepatitis B ( 80.4 % ) . 
Cirrhosis was present in 78.2 % . 
HCC was diagnosed during regular surveillance ( defined as mean interval of ultrasonography < 8 months , n = 834 ) , irregular surveillance ( n = 104 ) or nonsurveillance ( n = 464 ) . 
Patients in the regular surveillance group were diagnosed at earlier stages ( [ very ] early stage , 64.4 % ) than the irregular surveillance ( 40.4 % ) or nonsurveillance ( 26.9 % ) groups and had more chance for curative treatments ( 52.4 % ) than the irregular surveillance ( 39.4 % ) or nonsurveillance ( 23.3 % ) groups ( all P < 0.001 ) . 
Mortality risk was significantly lower in the regular surveillance group ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] , 0.69 ; 95 % [ CI ] , 0.57-0.83 ) but not in the irregular surveillance group ( aHR , 0.94 ; 95 % CI , 0.69-1.28 ) compared with the nonsurveillance group after adjusting for confounding factors and lead-time . 
When the subjects were restricted to cirrhotic patients or Child-Pugh class A/B patients , similar results were obtained for mortality risk reduction between groups . 
HCC surveillance was associated with longer survival owing to earlier diagnosis and curative treatment . 
Survival advantage was significant with regular surveillance but not with irregular surveillance . 
The aim of this study is to compare spironolactone versus clonidine as the fourth drug in patients with resistant hypertension in a multicenter , randomized trial . 
Medical therapy adherence was checked by pill counting . 
Patients with resistant hypertension ( no office and ambulatory blood pressure [ BP ] monitoring control , despite treatment with 3 drugs , including a diuretic , for 12 weeks ) were randomized to an additional 12-week treatment with spironolactone ( 12.5-50 mg QD ) or clonidine ( 0.1-0.3 mg BID ) . 
The primary end point was BP control during office ( < 140/90 mm Hg ) and 24-h ambulatory ( < 130/80 mm Hg ) BP monitoring . 
Secondary end points included BP control from each method and absolute BP reduction . 
From 1597 patients recruited , 11.7 % ( 187 patients ) fulfilled the resistant hypertension criteria . 
Compared with the spironolactone group ( n=95 ) , the clonidine group ( n=92 ) presented similar rates of achieving the primary end point ( 20.5 % versus 20.8 % , respectively ; relative risk , 1.01 [ 0.55-1.88 ] ; P=1.00 ) . 
Secondary end point analysis showed similar office BP ( 33.3 % versus 29.3 % ) and ambulatory BP monitoring ( 44 % versus 46.2 % ) control for spironolactone and clonidine , respectively . 
However , spironolactone promoted greater decrease in 24-h systolic and diastolic BP and diastolic daytime ambulatory BP than clonidine . 
Per-protocol analysis ( limited to patients with ≥80 % adherence to spironolactone/clonidine treatment ) showed similar results regarding the primary end point . 
In conclusion , clonidine was not superior to spironolactone in true resistant hypertensive patients , but the overall BP control was low ( ≈21 % ) . 
Considering easier posology and greater decrease in secondary end points , spironolactone is preferable for the fourth-drug therapy . 
Low serum vitamin D has been associated with metabolic syndrome and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . 
This study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation in treatment of patients with NAFLD . 
In a double blind , randomized , placebo controlled trial patients with NAFLD were randomized to receive one weekly pearl of placebo , 50,000 U vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) pearl per week and 0.25 mg calcitriol ( 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol ) pearl per day for 3 months . 
106 NAFLD patients were randomized to receive calcitriol , vitamin D3 and placebo pearls for 12 weeks and data for 91 patients were analyzed . 
After 12 weeks of treatment , serum alkaline phosphatase levels was significantly decreased from baseline levels in vitamin D and calcitriol treated groups ( P < 0.05 ) . 
Serum and gamma glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) level was also significantly decreased compared to the baseline levels after 12 weeks of treatment with vitamin D. There was no statistically significant difference between placebo , calcitriol , vitamin D groups in terms of serum aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase , serum GGT and lipid profile ( P > 0.05 ) . 
While significant reduction of serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT were seen with vitamin D and calcitriol supplementation from baseline levels , no beneficial effects was seen when comparing vitamin D , calcitriol and placebo groups at the end of trial . 
Emerging genetic , ex-vivo , and clinical trial evidence indicates that calcium channel blockers ( CCB ) can improve mood and cognitive function . 
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) therapy augmented with CCB on depression and cognitive decline in an elderly population with hypertension . 
Prospective study of 296 persons treated with SSRI and antihypertensive drugs . 
Baseline and two year clinic assessments were used to categorize participants as users of SSRI + CCB ( n = 53 ) or users of SSRI + other antihypertensives ( n = 243 ) . 
Clinic visits were performed up to four times in a ten-year period to assess depression and cognitive function . 
The sample mean age was 75.2 ± 5.47 years and 78 % of participants were female . 
At two year follow-up there was a significant group by time interaction showing lower Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression ( CESD ) scores in the SSRI + CCB group , F ( 1,291 ) = 4.13 , p = 0.043 , η2 p = 0.014 . 
Over ten-years follow-up , SSRI + CCB use was associated with improved general cognitive function ( Mini-Mental State Examination : β = 0.97 ; 95 % CI 0.14 to 1.81 , p = 0.023 ) and immediate visual memory ( Boston Visual Retention Test : β = 0.69 ; 95 % CI 0.06 to 1.32 , p = 0.033 ) . 
The findings provide general population evidence that SSRI augmentation with CCB may improve depression and cognitive function . 
This randomised trial compared three chemotherapy regimens in the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer , in terms of their effect on overall and progression-free survival ; other endpoints included toxicity , symptom palliation , and quality of life . 
905 patients were randomly assigned the de Gramont regimen ( n=303 ; folinic acid 200 mg/m ( 2 ) , fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m ( 2 ) , and infusion 600 mg/m ( 2 ) on days 1 and 2 , repeated every 14 days ) , the Lokich regimen ( n=301 ; protracted venous infusion of fluorouracil 300 mg/m ( 2 ) daily ) , or raltitrexed ( n=301 ; 3 mg/m ( 2 ) intravenously every 21 days ) . 
Analyses were by intention to treat . 
Median follow-up of survivors was 67 weeks . 
For the de Gramont , Lokich , and raltitrexed groups , respectively , median survival was 294 , 302 , and 266 days . 
The hazard ratios for overall survival were 0.88 ( 95 % CI 0.70-1.12 , p=0.17 ) for de Gramont versus Lokich , and 0.99 ( 0.79-1.25 , p=0.94 ) for de Gramont versus raltitrexed . 
An increase in treatment-related deaths was seen on raltitrexed ( de Gramont one , Lokich two , raltitrexed 18 ) due to combined gastrointestinal and haematological toxicity . 
Patients ' assessment of quality of life showed that raltitrexed was inferior to the fluorouracil-based regimens , especially in terms of palliation and functioning . 
The deGramont and Lokich regimens were similar in terms of survival , quality of life , and response rates . 
The Lokich regimen was associated with more central line complications and hand-foot syndrome . 
Raltitrexed showed similar response rates and overall survival to the de Gramont regimen and was easier to administer , but resulted in greater toxicity and inferior quality of life . 
Blood pressure ( BP ) lowering is considered neuroprotective in patients with cerebral small vessel disease ; however , more intensive regimens may increase cerebral hypoperfusion . 
This study examined the effect of standard vs intensive BP treatment on cerebral perfusion in patients with severe small vessel disease . 
To investigate whether standard vs intensive BP lowering over 3 months causes decreased cerebral perfusion in small vessel disease . 
This randomized clinical trial took place at 2 English university medical centers . 
Patients were randomized via a central online system ( in a 1:1 ratio ) . 
Seventy patients with hypertension and with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed symptomatic lacunar infarct and confluent white matter hyperintensities were recruited between February 29 , 2012 , and October 21 , 2015 , and randomized ( 36 in the standard group and 34 in the intensive group ) . 
Analyzable data were available in 62 patients , 33 in the standard group and 29 in the intensive group , for intent-to-treat analysis . 
This experiment examines the 3-month follow-up period . 
Patients were randomized to standard ( systolic , 130-140 mm Hg ) or intensive ( systolic , < 125 mm Hg ) BP targets , to be achieved through medication changes . 
Cerebral perfusion was measured using arterial spin labeling ; the primary end point was change in global perfusion between baseline and 3 months , compared between treatment groups by analysis of variance . 
Linear regression compared change in perfusion against change in BP . 
Magnetic resonance imaging scan analysis was masked to treatment group . 
Among 62 analyzable patients , the mean age was 69.3 years , and 60 % ( n = 37 ) were male . 
The mean ( SD ) systolic BP decreased by 8 ( 12 ) mm Hg in the standard group and by 27 ( 17 ) mm Hg in the intensive group ( P < .001 ) , with mean ( SD ) achieved pressures of 141 ( 13 ) and 126 ( 10 ) mm Hg , respectively . 
Change in global perfusion did not differ between treatment groups : the mean ( SD ) change was -0.5 ( 9.4 ) mL/min/100 g in the standard group vs 0.7 ( 8.6 ) mL/min/100 g in the intensive group ( partial η2 , 0.004 ; 95 % CI , -3.551 to 5.818 ; P = .63 ) . 
No differences were observed when the analysis examined gray or white matter only or was confined to those achieving target BP . 
The number of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups , with a mean ( SD ) of 0.21 ( 0.65 ) for the standard group and 0.32 ( 0.75 ) for the intensive group ( P = .44 ) . 
Intensive BP lowering did not reduce cerebral perfusion in severe small vessel disease . 
Ocular blood flow dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma . 
Whereas the effect of single antiglaucoma substances on ocular blood flow has been addressed in various experiments , evidence for fixed combinations is sparse . 
In the present study , we set out to compare the effects of latanoprost 0.005 % /timolol 0.5 % ( LT ) fixed combination and brimonidine 0.2 % /timolol 0.5 % ( BT ) fixed combination on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and ocular blood flow . 
In the present study , which followed a randomized , double-masked 2-way crossover design , 16 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 2 patients with ocular hypertension were included . 
The patients underwent a 6-week treatment with LT and a 6-week treatment with BT after a washout for previous antiglaucoma medication . 
Optic nerve head blood flow ( ONHBF ) was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry ; retrobulbar flow velocities were measured using color Doppler imaging in the ophthalmic artery , the central retinal artery , and the posterior ciliary arteries . 
IOP was measured at 8 AM , 12 PM , and 4 PM . 
The mean baseline IOP was 25.3 ±2.8 mmHg . 
Both drugs were equally effective in reducing IOP ( LT : -35.0 % ±10.0 % ; BT : -33.6 % ±8.8 % , P=0.463 between groups ) . 
In addition , no difference in ocular perfusion pressure was observed between the 2 treatment groups ( P=0.1 , between groups ) . 
Neither LT nor BT altered ONHBF ( P=0.4 , baseline vs. treatment ) and no effect on flow velocities in the retrobulbar vessels was seen with either of the 2 treatments . 
In the present study , a 6-week treatment with LT or BT was equally effective in reducing IOP . 
In addition , none of the administered drugs induced a significant effect on ocular blood flow parameters . 
The REVEAL risk score ( RRS ) was developed to predict survival in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , based on multiple patient characteristics . 
Herein we calculated RRS for patients in the randomized CHEST-1 study and open-label CHEST-2 extension study of riociguat in inoperable or persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) . 
We investigated the effect of riociguat vs placebo on RRS in the CHEST-1 study , and the relationship between RRS and long-term outcomes in the CHEST-2 study . 
RRS was calculated post hoc for baseline and Week 16 of CHEST-1 and Week 12 of CHEST-2 , based on 9 evaluable elements . 
Patients were grouped into risk strata by RRS . 
Relationships between RRS and both survival and clinical worsening-free survival were examined by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses . 
Overall , 237 patients completed CHEST-1 and entered CHEST-2 . 
In CHEST-1 , riociguat significantly improved RRS ( p < 0.0001 ) and risk stratum ( p < 0.001 ) vs placebo from baseline to Week 16 . 
RRS at baseline , and at Week 16 , and change in RRS during CHEST-1 were significantly associated with survival ( hazard ratios for a 1-point reduction in RRS : 0.702 , 0.692 , and 0.682 , respectively ) and clinical worsening-free survival ( hazard ratios : 0.697 , 0.719 , and 0.754 , respectively ) over 2 years in CHEST-2 . 
Riociguat improved RRS in patients with inoperable and persistent/recurrent CTEPH . 
RRS at baseline and Week 16 , and change in RRS from baseline , predicted survival and clinical worsening-free survival . 
This analysis of RRS in patients with inoperable or persistent/recurrent CTEPH suggests utility for the RRS in indications beyond PAH . 
High blood pressure ( BP ) is a common chronic disease needs long life drug consumption to control . 
Spironolactone could be used as the fourth-line therapy in patients with resistant hypertension . 
However , there is no study to determine the effects of low dose spironolactone as a first line therapy in treatment of essential hypertension . 
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of low dose spironolactone monotherapy in management of essential hypertension . 
In this double blind randomized clinical trial , 40 patients who had stage I essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups : intervention group received spironolactone 25 milligram once daily for one month and control group received placebo once daily . 
At the baseline and after one month , 24-hour BP holter-monitoring and serum potassium assay were done . 
Systolic BP was reduced from 143.5 ± 8.2 mmHg to 137.10 ± 7.57 mmHg in the intervention group , while it did not change significantly in control ( between group treatment difference = -4.5 mmHg , p = 0.004 ) . 
There was no significant reduction of diastolic BP in the intervention group in comparison to placebo group ( between group treatment difference = -1.3 mmHg , p = 0.099 ) . 
Short course monotherapy with low dose spironolactone is effective in reducing systolic BP in patients with stage I essential hypertension . 
Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) in children is a serious health problem worldwide . 
How to treat children with immune-tolerant chronic hepatitis B infection , commonly characterized by hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positivity , high viral load , normal or mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase and no or minimal inflammation in liver histology , remains unresolved . 
This trial aims to study the benefits of antiviral therapy in children with these characteristics . 
This is a pilot open-label randomized controlled study . 
From May 2014 to April 2015 , 69 treatment-naive chronically HBV-infected children , aged 1 to 16 years , who had immune-tolerant characteristics were recruited to this trial and randomly assigned , in a 2:1 ratio , to treatment group and control group . 
Patients in the treatment group received either interferon-α ( IFN ) monotherapy or consecutively received IFN monotherapy , combination therapy of IFN and lamivudine ( LAM ) , and LAM therapy alone . 
All patients were observed until week 96 . 
At baseline , epidemiological , biochemical , serological , virological and histological indices were consistent across the treatment and control groups . 
Of the 46 patients in the treatment group , 73.91 % had undetectable serum HBV DNA , 32.61 % achieved HBeAg seroconversion and 21.74 % lost hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) at the endpoint . 
No LAM resistance emerged at week 96 . 
In the control group , only one ( 4.35 % ) patient underwent spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and had undetectable serum HBV DNA during observation , and moreover , none developed HBsAg clearance . 
For all patients , no serious adverse events were observed . 
Antiviral treatment with a sequential combination of IFN and LAM resulted in a significant improvement in the rates of undetectable serum HBV DNA , HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss in children with chronic HBV infection and immune-tolerant characteristics . 
There is a lack of data regarding treatment of immune-tolerant chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) . 
It remains unresolved how children with immune-tolerant CHB should be treated . 
This paper reports the outcomes from a pilot open-label randomized controlled trial on antiviral therapy in children with immune-tolerant characteristics . 
It shows that a sequential combination of interferon-α and lamivudine was beneficial . 
The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide ( AZT ) modulates blood pressure at high altitude and reduces sleep-disordered breathing in patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . 
We aimed to investigate the treatment effect of AZT and in combination with continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on blood pressure in patients with hypertension and OSA . 
In a prospective , randomized , three-way crossover study , 13 male patients with hypertension and moderate to severe OSA ( age 64 ± 7 years , body mass index 29 ± 4 kg/m2 , and mean apnea-hypopnea index 37 ± 23 events/h ) received AZT , CPAP , or AZT plus CPAP for 2-week periods . 
Antihypertensive medication was washed out . 
Office and 24-hour blood pressure , arterial stiffness , polygraphic sleep study data , and blood chemistry were compared . 
AZT alone and AZT plus CPAP , but not CPAP alone , reduced office mean arterial pressure compared to baseline ( -7 [ 95 % CI -11 to -4 ] , -7 [ 95 % CI -11 to -4 ] and -1 [ 95 % CI -5 to 4 ] mmHg , respectively ; repeated- measures analysis of variance ( RM-ANOVA ; P = .015 ) . 
Aortic systolic pressure and augmentation index , assessed by radial artery oscillatory tonometry , were unaffected by CPAP but decreased after AZT and AZT plus CPAP ( RM-ANOVA P = .030 and .031 , respectively ) . 
The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly reduced in all three treatment arms , most prominently by AZT plus CPAP ( RM-ANOVA P = .003 ) . 
The reduction of venous bicarbonate concentration following AZT was correlated with the change of apnea-hypopnea index ( r = 0.66 , P = .013 ) . 
AZT reduced blood pressure , vascular stiffness , and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with OSA and comorbid hypertension . 
Carbonic anhydrase inhibition may constitute a potential target for drug therapy in patients with sleep apnea and comorbid hypertension . 
The purpose of this review is to correlate predictions based on pre-clinical data with outcomes from clinical trials that examine the effects of incretin-based diabetes treatments on the kidney . 
The incretin-based treatments include agonists of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) and inhibitors of the enzyme , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) . 
In addition , what is known about the incretin-based therapies will be compared to what is known about the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors . 
Large-scale clinical trials have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce albuminuria and preserve estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) in patients with diabetic nephropathy . 
A concise and plausible hemodynamic mechanism is supported by pre-clinical research on the physiology and pharmacology of SGLT2 . 
Large-scale clinical trials have shown that incretin-based therapies mitigate albuminuria but have not shown beneficial effects on eGFR . 
Research on the incretin-based therapies has yielded a diverse array of direct effects throughout the body , which fuels speculation as to how these drugs might benefit the diabetic kidney and affect its function ( s ) . 
But in vivo experiments have yet to confirm that the proposed mechanisms underlying emergent phenomena , such as proximal tubular fluid reabsorption , are the ones predicted by cell and molecular experiments . 
There may be salutary effects of incretin-based treatments on the diabetic kidney , but the system is complex and not amenable to simple explanation or prior prediction . 
This contrasts with the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors , which can be explained concisely . 
To compare efficacy ( intraocular pressure ( IOP ) reduction ) and safety of preservative-free latanoprost ( T2345 ) to benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) -preserved latanoprost ( BPL ; Xalatan ) in ocular hypertension ( OHT ) or primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) patients . 
Prospective , international , multicentre , randomised , investigator-masked , parallel-group trial . 
After a wash-out period , POAG or OHT patients , previously managed by BPL monotherapy , randomly received T2345 or BPL ( one drop into the affected eye ( s ) ) once daily from D0 to D84 . 
Change in IOP was measured at 09:00 ( ±1 h ) from D0 to D84 in the worse eye . 
Mean IOP reduction ( D0-D84 ) was -8.6 ±2.6 mm Hg ( -36 % ) on T2345 and -9.0 ±2.4 mm Hg ( -38 % ) on BPL , confirming non-inferiority of T2345 to BPL . 
Non-inferiority of T2345 was observed from D15 . 
The most frequent ocular adverse event , drug intolerance , was reported in 1 ( 0.5 % ) patient on T2345 versus 4 ( 2.1 % ) patients on BPL . 
Moderate to severe conjunctival hyperaemia was less frequent on T2345 than on BPL at D42 ( 20.2 % vs 30.6 % ; p=0.003 ) and D84 ( 21.4 % vs 29.1 % ; p=0.02 ) . 
Upon instillation , the global subjective ocular symptom score was significantly lower on T2345 than BPL on D42 ( 0.15 vs 0.41 ; p=0.001 ) and D84 ( 0.18 vs 0.46 ; p=0.001 ) . 
Preservative-free latanoprost has the same efficacy as BPL , with improved local tolerance . 
Intradialytic hypotension ( IDH ) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among hemodialysis patients . 
We used an immersion model to evaluate the role of reduced effective circulating volume , and to examine whether facilitated refilling can prevent IDH . 
Ten male hemodialysis patients who had frequent episodes of IDH were randomized to a mid-week " wet " or " dry " hemodialysis session , and subsequently underwent the other session in a crossover manner . 
The wet sessions were performed while immersed up to the neck in a 34 to 35°C bath , and the dry session was standard hemodialysis . 
Ultrafiltration goals were determined as the mean ultrafiltration during the 10 sessions preceding the first study session ± 10 % . 
Mean ultrafiltration was similar for the wet and dry sessions ( 2.99 ± 0.64 kg vs. 2.96 ± 0.74 kg ) . 
Symptomatic hypotension did not develop in any of the patients during the wet session , compared to 4 ( 40 % ) during the dry session . 
Systolic blood pressure adjusted to ultrafiltration was stable during the wet session , 0.22 mmHg/15 min ( 95 % CI -0.27 to 0.70 ) , P = 0.38 , and significantly decreased during the dry session , -0.68 mmHg/15 min ( 95 % CI -1.24 to -0.11 ) , P = 0.02 . 
Diastolic blood pressure did not change during the sessions . 
Mean atrial natriuretic peptide significantly increased in the wet session , by 31.36 pgr/mL ( 95 % CI 8.73-53.99 ) , P = 0.007 , and slightly and insignificantly decreased in the dry session , by 21.66 pgr/mL ( 95 % CI -52.59 to 9.25 ) , P = 0.167 . 
Aldosterone blood levels did not change . 
Reduced effective circulating volume is a major cause for IDH , which can be prevented using head-out water immersion facilitated redistribution . 
To compare intraocular pressure ( IOP ) over time after standard trabeculectomy vs Ex-PRESS implantation in patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . 
Prospective , randomised study . 
This study included adult patients with bilateral POAG necessitating surgery . 
Each patient underwent trabeculectomy in one eye and Ex-PRESS implantation under a scleral flap in the other eye according to randomised contralateral allocations . 
Efficacy was assessed by IOP values and success rates ( IOP threshold and/or need for topical glaucoma medication ) during 30 months . 
Statistical analysis included Generalised Estimate Equation and Cox Survival models , and paired t-tests . 
Thirty eyes of 15 patients were studied for a mean of 23.6 months ( SD , ± 6.9 ) . 
At the last follow-up visit , mean pre-operative IOP decreased from 31.1 ( ± 14.2 ) to 16.2 ( ± 1.5 ) mm Hg after trabeculectomy , and from 28.1 ( ± 9.0 ) to 15.7 ( ± 1.8 ) mm Hg after Ex-PRESS implantation ( P=0.001 ) . 
The mean number of anti-glaucoma medicines prescribed at the last follow-up decreased from 3.7 pre-operatively ( both groups ) to 0.9 after trabeculectomy vs 0.3 after Ex-PRESS implantation ( P=0.001 ) . 
Complete success rates ( 5 < IOP < 18 mm Hg without medications ) were higher with Ex-PRESS compared with trabeculectomy ( P=0.0024 ) . 
Postoperative complications were more frequent after trabeculectomy ( 33 % ) compared with Ex-PRESS ( 20 % ) , with four trabeculectomy eyes ( 27 % ) needing postoperative interventions , compared with none with Ex-PRESS . 
Trabeculectomy and Ex-PRESS implantation provided similar IOP control , but the Ex-PRESS group had a lower rate of complications , fewer postoperative interventions , and needed less glaucoma medications . 
Sodium nitrite has been reported to be effective in reducing chronic peripheral pain . 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 40 and 80 mg , BID , of an oral sustained release formulation of sodium nitrite ( SR-nitrite ) in patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy , and to determine whether SR-nitrite would reduce the frequency of headaches reported previously by subjects receiving the same doses of an immediate release formulation . 
Phase II , single-center , randomized , double-blind , placebo controlled clinical trial . 
Twenty-four patients were randomized to 40 mg or 80 mg SR-nitrite or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks . 
The primary objective was to determine whether headaches would be reduced using SR-nitrite . 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean difference in the change of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory ( NPSI ) pain score from baseline to that reported after 12 weeks of treatment . 
Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline for the Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) Scale , the RAND 36 questionnaire , Short Form McGill Questionnaire , daily patient reported score for neuropathic pain , changes in HbA1c , PulseOx and quantitative sensory testing . 
The number of subjects reporting adverse events and the number of adverse events did not change with dose . 
There were no reports of treatment-related headaches . 
Although no significant differences were identified in patient responses to the questionnaires , a trend was observed . 
In the NPSI assessment , patients in the 40 mg and 80 mg dose group reported a 12.7 % and 22.0 % reduction in pain , respectively , compared to an 8.4 % reduction by patients in the placebo group . 
A trend was also observed with the BPI total severity score . 
However , the 40 mg dosing group reported the greatest reduction in pain using the McGill Pain index and via patient logs of daily pain scores , where the mean of pain scores reported by subjects in the 40 mg group dropped by day 41 and generally stayed lower than the mean of scores reported by subjects in either of the other two groups . 
Patients in the 80 mg SR-nitrite group had an improvement in both Nerve Sensory Conductance and Nerve Sensory Velocity . 
No changes were observed in HbA1c levels or PulseOx . 
Sustained release sodium nitrite prevents the prevalent reports of headaches by patients treated with an immediate release formulation of sodium nitrite . 
In a previous study of patients with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , 40 mg BID treatment led to a statistically significant reduction in reported pain , similar trends were observed at the end of the trial period for most of the pain questionnaires used in the study . 
The 80 mg BID treatment had the more pronounced affect on bioactivity ( quantitative sensory testing ) , which was similar to the PAD study , where this dose group had the greatest improvement in FMD { AU : spell out FMD } . 
The ability to alleviate pain with BID treatment of SR-nitrite offers promise for a new non-addictive , non-sedating treatment of chronic pain and warrants further study . 
We investigated the effects of high-Ca fat-free milk phase ( MD ) ( prescription of approximately 1500 mg of Ca/d ) v. low-Ca phase ( CD ) ( prescription of approximately 800 mg of Ca/d ) in an energy-restricted diet on the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) and cardiometabolic measures in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and low habitual Ca consumption ( < 600 mg/d ) . 
In this randomised cross-over design , fourteen adults with T2DM ( 49·5 ( sd 8·6 ) years , BMI 29·4 ( sd 4·5 ) kg/m2 ) consumed either MD or CD for 12 weeks , with a washout of 18 weeks between phases . 
A breakfast shake containing 700 mg ( MD ) or 6·4 mg ( CD ) of Ca was consumed in the laboratory . 
In addition , energy-restricted diets were prescribed ( 800 mg of dietary Ca/d ) . 
Waist circumference ( WC ) , fasting glucose , fasting TAG , systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , fasting total cholesterol , fasting LDL-cholesterol , fasting HDL-cholesterol , HDL : LDL ratio , HDL : TAG ratio and lipid accumulation product ( LAP ) index were assessed at baseline and after each phase . 
Ca consumption during the study was equivalent to 1200 mg/d during MD and 525 mg/d during CD . 
There was a greater reduction in WC , SBP , DBP and LAP index after MD compared with CD . 
HDL : LDL ratio increased and total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , SBP , DBP and LAP index decreased only in MD . 
The consumption of approximately 1200 mg of Ca/d ( 700 mg from fat-free milk+500mg from other dietary sources ) associated with an energy-restricted diet decreased some of the MetS components and cardiometabolic measures in adults with T2DM . 
This study aimed to propose the role of amniotic membrane transplantation ( AMT ) as an additional modulator in primary Mitomycin C ( MMC ) -augmented trabeculectomy . 
This was a randomized prospective interventional study . 
Forty eyes of 39 adult patients with uncontrolled primary glaucoma were randomly divided into two equal groups . 
Control group underwent trabeculectomy augmented with MMC while the study group underwent additional AMT . 
Patients were followed up for 12 months and outcomes measured were intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , need for additional intervention , and bleb morphology . 
Complete success ( defined as IOP < 16 mmHg on no medication ) could be achieved in 85 % eyes in study group while it was 60 % in control group ( P = 0.04 ) . 
IOP reduced by 71.1 % in study group from 41.9 ± 10.6 to 12.1 ± 2.7 mmHg and from 40.5 ± 8.5 to 12.8 ± 4.5 mmHg in control group , a decline of 68.29 % . 
Blebs in AMT group showed better bleb morphology in terms of significantly better extent ( E3 ) on day 1 ( P = 0.03 ) and better height ( H2 and H3 ) ( P = 0.04 ) , according to the Indiana Bleb Appearance Grading Scale , at all follow-up visits along with normal vascularity . 
The study group required significantly lesser ( P = 0.03 ) bleb needlings as compared to control group . 
Amnion enhanced the efficacy of MMC-modulated trabeculectomy in terms of eyes with complete success and lesser interventions such as bleb needling . 
This reiterates the role of amnion as a safe and effective bleb modulator . 
A diffusely elevated bleb with healthier conjunctiva can go a long way in predicting better health and longevity of the bleb . 
Methionine aminopeptidase 2 ( MetAP2 ) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control . 
This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor , ZGN-1061 . 
This clinical trial included a single ascending dose ( SAD ) phase in healthy subjects ( BMI 23 to < 30 kg/m2 ) and a multiple ascending dose ( MAD ) phase in otherwise healthy subjects with BMI 27 to 40 kg/m2 . 
SAD phase doses , administered subcutaneously ( SC ) were 0.2 , 0.6 , 1.2 , 2.4 , 3.6 , and 4.8 mg , and MAD phase evaluated 0.2 , 0.6 , and 1.8 mg twice weekly SC for 4 weeks . 
SAD phase included 39 subjects ( ZGN-1061 N=28 , placebo N=11 ) , 90 % male and BMI 26.4 kg/m2 . 
ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses with most frequent adverse events of mild headache and procedural-related irritation . 
There were no severe or serious adverse events . 
All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared , resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks . 
The MAD phase included 29 subjects ( ZGN-1061 N=22 , placebo N=7 ) , 76 % male and BMI 33.5 kg/m2 . 
Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings . 
Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change ( -1.5 kg total ZGN-1061 vs -0.2 kg placebo ) and other biomarker changes . 
ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested . 
In addition , the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials . 
To compare the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty ( SLT ) and travoprost on 24-hour IOP fluctuations in primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) and normal-tension glaucoma ( NTG ) . 
Sixty eyes were included . 
Sixteen and 14 eyes of POAG patients were randomized to receive 360° SLT or 0.004 % travoprost , respectively . 
Fourteen and 16 eyes of NTG patients were randomized to receive either SLT or travoprost , respectively . 
The 24-hour IOP data were collected before treatment and 6 to 8 weeks after treatment . 
IOP was measured at 2 hours intervals in the sitting position during daytime ( 9 AM to 7 PM ) and in the supine position during nighttime ( 9 PM to 7 AM ) . 
Main outcome measure was the percentage of eyes that achieved posttreatment 24-hour IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg . 
Success in fluctuation reduction was defined as at least a 50 % reduction in these fluctuations . 
Fifty-eight eyes were analyzed . 
Overall , eyes in the SLT and the travoprost groups achieved a significant reduction in IOP compared with the baseline IOP values ( -3.7 mm Hg [ P = 0.002 ] vs -4.1 mm Hg [ P < 0.001 ] , respectively ) . 
There was no significant difference in IOP reduction in both groups according to type of glaucoma . 
During the diurnal period , 100 % of POAG eyes in the travoprost group achieved posttreatment IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg , and 87 % of eyes in the SLT group achieved the same level of fluctuations ( P < 0.001 ) . 
Ninety-six percent of NTG eyes in the travoprost group , and 82 % of eyes in the SLT group had IOP fluctuations < 3 mm Hg ( P = 0.01 ) . 
Success in fluctuation reduction was 75 % and 92 % for the SLT and travoprost groups , respectively ( P = 0.005 ) . 
The effect of travoprost on IOP reduction in POAG and NTG patients was significant both during the daytime and the nighttime , while the SLT 's effect was significant only during the nighttime . 
Both travoprost and SLT can significantly reduce the IOP in patients with POAG and NTG . 
Based on habitual positions , travoprost better controls IOP fluctuations than SLT , especially during the daytime . 
To compare the additive effects and safety of 1 % brinzolamide/0.5 % timolol fixed combination ( BTFC ) versus the low-dose regimen of 1 % dorzolamide/0.5 % timolol fixed combination ( DTFC ) in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension ( OAG/OH ) following treatment with prostaglandin analogues ( PGAs ) . 
A prospective , randomized , double-masked , multicentre , parallel-group and active-controlled study included 201 Japanese OAG/OH patients who had been treated with PGA . 
Efficacy was assessed as the change in intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) from baseline after weeks 4 and 8 . 
Safety was assessed with adverse event rates , ocular discomfort score , blur scale , blood pressure and heart rates , best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) and slit lamp examinations . 
Intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) change from baseline at 9 AM/11 AM pooled over the 8 weeks was -3.3/-3.3 mmHg in the BTFC group and -2.9/-3.4 mmHg in the DTFC group , demonstrating non-inferiority of BTFC to DTFC . 
Ocular irritation was frequently seen in DTFC group . 
Although blurred vision was frequently seen in BTFC group , it was transient and blurring became the equivalent 3 min after instillation between two groups . 
No noteworthy issue was observed in other safety outcome . 
Non-inferiority of BTFC to DTFC in IOP reduction was demonstrated after adding onto PGA therapy in Japanese OAG/OH patients . 
Although the score of blurred vision was transiently higher in BTFC than DTFC , treatment difference decreased and disappeared with time . 
Thus , BTFC can be considered as a safe and effective agent for glaucoma treatment . 
The efficacy of switching to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) monotherapy from lamivudine ( LAM ) plus adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) combination therapy ( stable switching ) in patients with LAM-resistant chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) and undetectable hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA is not clear . 
In this non-inferiority trial , patients with LAM-resistant CHB and undetectable serum HBV DNA ( < 20 IU/mL ) for > 6 months after initiating LAM+ADV combination therapy were randomized ( 1:2 ) either to continue the combination therapy ( LAM+ADV group , n = 58 ) or switched to TDF monotherapy ( TDF group , n = 111 ) . 
They were followed-up with serum biochemistry tests and HBV DNA measurement at 12-week intervals for 96 weeks . 
The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients with viral reactivation at week 96 . 
Patients with CHB enrolled in this study ( n = 169 ) included 74 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis . 
In total , 9 patients ( 4 in the LAM+ADV group and 5 in the TDF group ) dropped-out from the study . 
After a mean follow-up period of 96 weeks , the proportion of HBV reactivation observed was 6.8 % ( 4/58 ) in the LAM+ADV group and 4.5 % ( 5/111 ) in the TDF group by using intention-to-treat analysis ( difference , -2.3 % ; 95 % CI , -9.84-5.24 % ) . 
None of the subjects in either group experienced viral reactivation based on per protocol analysis . 
No serious adverse reactions were observed . 
In the subgroup analysis for estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) before and after treatment , decreased eGFR was observed only in the TDF group with cirrhosis ( 85.22 vs. 79.83 mL/min/1.73 m2 , p = 0.000 ) . 
Stable switching to TDF monotherapy yielded non-inferior results at 96 weeks compared to the results obtained with LAM+ADV combination therapy in patients with LAM-resistant CHB and undetectable HBV DNA . 
However , TDF monotherapy in patients with cirrhosis requires close attention with respect to renal function . 
To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of a single trabecular micro-bypass stent with concomitant cataract surgery versus cataract surgery alone for mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma . 
Twenty-nine investigational sites , United States . 
Prospective randomized controlled multicenter clinical trial . 
Eyes with mild to moderate glaucoma with an unmedicated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of 22 mm Hg or higher and 36 mm Hg or lower were randomly assigned to have cataract surgery with iStent trabecular micro-bypass stent implantation ( stent group ) or cataract surgery alone ( control group ) . 
Patients were followed for 24 months postoperatively . 
The incidence of adverse events was low in both groups through 24 months of follow-up . 
At 24 months , the proportion of patients with an IOP of 21 mm Hg or lower without ocular hypotensive medications was significantly higher in the stent group than in the control group ( P=.036 ) . 
Overall , the mean IOP was stable between 12 months and 24 months ( 17.0 mm Hg ± 2.8 [ SD ] and 17.1 ± 2.9 mm Hg , respectively ) in the stent group but increased ( 17.0 ± 3.1 mm Hg to 17.8 ± 3.3 mm Hg , respectively ) in the control group . 
Ocular hypotensive medication was statistically significantly lower in the stent group at 12 months ; it was also lower at 24 months , although the difference was no longer statistically significant . 
Patients with combined single trabecular micro-bypass stent and cataract surgery had significantly better IOP control on no medication through 24 months than patients having cataract surgery alone . 
Both groups had a similar favorable long-term safety profile . 
To compare the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) -lowering effect and safety of topical brimonidine to that of timolol , and to study the additive effect of topical brimonidine to topical prostaglandin ( PG ) analogues in 475 patients with either ocular hypertension or primary open angle glaucoma . 
The primary endpoint was the mean IOP change from the baseline at 0 and 2 hours at week 4 . 
The mean changes were -4.7 +/- 2.1 ( S. D. ) in the timolol and -4.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg in the brimonidine group ( p = 0.0138 ) . 
The 95 % confidence interval of the inter-group difference was greater than the pre-determined criterion of non-inferiority of brimonidine to timolol . 
When added to PG analogues , the IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine ( -2.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg ) was greater than that of the placebo ( -2.1 +/- 1.8 mmHg ) ( p = 0.0010 ) . 
No appreciable adverse side effects were encountered . 
Topical brimonidine showed an additive IOP-lowering effect to topical PG analogues , although its IOP-lowering effect was inferior to topical timolol as monotherapy . 
To compare blood pressure and urine albumin-creatinine ratio over time for participants receiving aflibercept , bevacizumab , or ranibizumab . 
Preplanned secondary analyses from a randomized trial comparing aflibercept , bevacizumab , and ranibizumab for diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . 
The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) enrolled 660 participants with DME and visual acuity 20/32 or worse in at least one eye . 
Eyes received intravitreous injections of 2.0 mg aflibercept , 1.25 mg bevacizumab , or 0.3 mg ranibizumab based on a structured retreatment protocol over 2 years . 
Main outcome measures were ( 1 ) a change in blood pressure at 2 years , and ( 2 ) a change in urine albumin-creatinine ratio ( UACR ) at 1 year . 
At baseline , 95 participants ( 14 % ) had normal blood pressure , 220 ( 33 % ) had borderline blood pressure elevation , 206 ( 31 % ) had mild blood pressure elevation , and 139 ( 21 % ) had moderate blood pressure elevation . 
Average change in mean arterial pressure from baseline to 2 years was -1.2 ± 15 , -1.8 ± 13.5 , -2.6 ± 14.4 mm Hg in the aflibercept , bevacizumab , and ranibizumab groups , respectively ( global P = 0.69 ) . 
At baseline 247 participants ( 38 % ) had no albuminuria ( < 30 mg/g ) , 195 ( 30 % ) had microalbuminuria ( 30-300 mg/g ) , and 212 ( 32 % ) had macroalbuminuria ( > 300 mg/g ) . 
Changes in UACR category were not different among treatment groups at the 52-week visit ( global P = 0.29 ) . 
There do not appear to be treatment group differences for changes in blood pressure or UACR as a reflection of kidney function in patients with DME treated with aflibercept , bevacizumab , or ranibizumab . 
Androgen deprivation therapy is a common treatment in men with prostate cancer that may cause fatigue , functional decline , increased body fatness , and loss of lean body tissue . 
These physical changes can negatively affect health-related quality of life . 
Resistance exercise may help to counter some of these side effects by reducing fatigue , elevating mood , building muscle mass , and reducing body fat . 
In a two-site study , 155 men with prostate cancer who were scheduled to receive androgen deprivation therapy for at least 3 months after recruitment were randomly assigned to an intervention group that participated in a resistance exercise program three times per week for 12 weeks ( 82 men ) or to a waiting list control group ( 73 men ) . 
The primary outcomes were fatigue and disease-specific quality of life as assessed by self-reported questionnaires after 12 weeks . 
Secondary outcomes were muscular fitness and body composition . 
Men assigned to resistance exercise had less interference from fatigue on activities of daily living ( P =.002 ) and higher quality of life ( P =.001 ) than men in the control group . 
Men in the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of upper body ( P =.009 ) and lower body ( P < .001 ) muscular fitness than men in the control group . 
The 12-week resistance exercise intervention did not improve body composition as measured by changes in body weight , body mass index , waist circumference , or subcutaneous skinfolds . 
Resistance exercise reduces fatigue and improves quality of life and muscular fitness in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy . 
This form of exercise can be an important component of supportive care for these patients . 
To compare protracted venous infusion ( PVI ) fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) with PVI 5-FU plus mitomycin ( MMC ) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in a multicenter , prospectively randomized study . 
Two hundred eight patients were randomized to PVI 5-FU ( 300 mg/m ( 2 ) /d for a maximum of 24 weeks ) or PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( 7 mg/m ( 2 ) every 6 weeks for four courses ) . 
The major end points were tumor response , survival , toxicity , and quality of life ( QOL ) . 
The two treatment groups were balanced for baseline demographic factors , and 62 % had metastatic disease . 
The overall response rate was 8.4 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) 3.2 % to 13.7 % for patients treated with PVI 5-FU alone compared with 17.6 % ; 95 % CI 10.3 % to 25.1 % for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.04 ) . 
Median failure-free survival was 2.8 months for PVI 5-FU and 3.8 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.14 ) . 
Median survival was 5.1 months for PVI 5-FU and 6.5 months for PVI 5-FU plus MMC ( P =.34 ) . 
Toxicities in both arms were mild . 
There was an increased incidence of neutropenia in the 5-FU plus MMC arm ( P < .01 ) , although no differences in infection were seen . 
No patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome . 
Global QOL improved significantly after 24 weeks of treatment compared with baseline for patients receiving 5-FU plus MMC , although there was no statistically significant difference in QOL between arms . 
PVI 5-FU plus MMC resulted in a superior response rate in comparison with PVI 5-FU alone in advanced pancreatic cancer , but this did not translate into a survival advantage . 
These results emphasize the importance of chemotherapy in this setting and the continuing value of the fluoropyrimidines in pancreatic cancer . 
Fracture risk is increased in individuals with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . 
The pathophysiological mechanisms accentuating fracture risk in T2D are convoluted , incorporating factors such as hyperglycaemia , insulinopenia , and antidiabetic drugs . 
The objectives of this study were to assess whether different insulin regimens , metformin and rosiglitazone influence bone metabolism . 
We explored if the concentration of metformin and rosiglitazone in blood or improved glycaemic control altered bone turnover . 
Two-year clinical trial designed to investigate effects of antidiabetic treatment in 371 T2D patients . 
Participants were randomized to short or long-acting human insulin ( non-blinded ) and then further randomized to metformin + placebo , rosiglitazone + placebo , metformin + rosiglitazone or placebo + placebo ( blinded ) . 
Fasting bone turnover markers ( BTM ) representing bone resorption ( CTX ) and formation ( PINP ) including HbA1c were measured at baseline and after 3 , 12 and 24 months . 
Trough steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin and rosiglitazone were measured after 3 , 6 and 9 months of treatment . 
Associations between treatments and BTMs during the follow-up of the trial were analysed in mixed-effects models that included adjustments for age , gender , BMI , renal function and repeated measures of HbA1c . 
BTMs increased from baseline to month 12 and remained higher at month 24 , with CTX and PINP increasing 28.5 % and 23.0 % ( all : p < 0.001 ) , respectively . 
Allocation of insulin regimens was not associated with different levels of BTMs . 
Metformin and metformin + rosiglitazone but not rosiglitazone alone were associated with lower bone formation ( PINP ) . 
Neither metformin nor rosiglitazone plasma concentrations was associated with BTMs . 
HbA1c was inversely associated with CTX but not P1NP . 
The choice of insulin treatment is not influencing BTMs , metformin treatment may decrease BTMs , and improvement of glycaemic control may influence bone resorption activity . 
To investigate the clinical effect and safety of long-acting pegylated interferon-α-2b ( Peg-IFN-α-2b ) ( Y shape , 40 kD ) injection ( 180 μg/week ) in the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patients , with standard-dose Peg-IFN-α-2a as positive control . 
This study was a multicenter , randomized , open-label , and positive-controlled phase III clinical trial . 
Eligible HBeAg-positive CHB patients were screened out and randomized to Peg-IFN-α-2b ( Y shape , 40 kD ) trial group and Peg-IFN-α-2a control group at a ratio of 2:1 . 
The course of treatment was 48 weeks and the patients were followed up for 24 weeks after drug withdrawal . 
Plasma samples were collected at screening , baseline , and 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 weeks for centralized detection . 
COBAS® Ampliprep/COBAS® TaqMan® HBV Test was used to measure HBV DNA level by quantitative real-time PCR . 
Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay with Elecsys kit was used to measure HBV markers ( HBsAg , anti-HBs , HBeAg , anti-HBe ) . 
Adverse events were recorded in detail . 
The primary outcome measure was HBeAg seroconversion rate after the 24-week follow-up , and non-inferiority was also tested . 
The difference in HBeAg seroconversion rate after treatment between the trial group and the control group and two-sided confidence interval ( CI ) were calculated , and non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of 95 % CI was > -10 % . 
The t-test , chi-square test , or rank sum test was used according to the types and features of data . 
A total of 855 HBeAg-positive CHB patients were enrolled and 820 of them received treatment ( 538 in the trial group and 282 in the control group ) . 
The data of the full analysis set showed that HBeAg seroconversion rate at week 72 was 27.32 % in the trial group and 22.70 % in the control group with a rate difference of 4.63 % ( 95 % CI -1.54 % to 10.80 % , P = 0.1493 ) . 
The data of the per-protocol set showed that HBeAg seroconversion rate at week 72 was 30.75 % in the trial group and 27.14 % in the control group with a rate difference of 3.61 % ( 95 % CI -3.87 % to 11.09 % , P = 0.3436 ) . 
95 % CI met the non-inferiority criteria , and the trial group was non-inferior to the control group . 
The two groups had similar incidence rates of adverse events , serious adverse events , and common adverse events . 
In Peg-IFN-α regimen for HBeAg-positive CHB patients , the new drug Peg-IFN-α-2b ( Y shape , 40 kD ) has comparable effect and safety to the control drug Peg-IFN-α-2a . 
Available data indicate that dietary sodium ( as salt ) relates directly to blood pressure ( BP ) . 
Most of these findings are from studies lacking dietary data ; hence , it is unclear whether this sodium-BP relationship is modulated by other dietary factors . 
With control for multiple nondietary factors , but not body mass index , there were direct relations to BP of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion and the urinary sodium/potassium ratio among 4680 men and women 40 to 59 years of age ( 17 population samples in China , Japan , United Kingdom , and United States ) in the INTERMAP ( International Study on Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure ) , and among its 2195 American participants , for example , 2 SD higher 24-hour urinary sodium excretion ( 118.7 mmol ) associated with systolic BP 3.7 mm Hg higher . 
These sodium-BP relations persisted with control for 13 macronutrients , 12 vitamins , 7 minerals , and 18 amino acids , for both sex , older and younger , blacks , Hispanics , whites , and socioeconomic strata . 
With control for body mass index , sodium-BP-but not sodium/potassium-BP-relations were attenuated . 
Normal weight and obese participants manifested significant positive relations to BP of urinary sodium ; relations were weaker for overweight people . 
At lower but not higher levels of 24-hour sodium excretion , potassium intake blunted the sodium-BP relation . 
The adverse association of dietary sodium with BP is minimally attenuated by other dietary constituents ; these findings underscore the importance of reducing salt intake for the prevention and control of prehypertension and hypertension . 
Evidence has shown that long-term sodium reduction can not only reduce blood pressure , but also provide cardiovascular benefits . 
To date , there is little evidence related to the effects of salt reduction on isolated systolic hypertension ( ISH ) .A total of 126 hypertensive patients were divided into an ISH group ( n = 51 ) and a non-ISH ( NISH ) group ( n = 75 ) . 
The members of each group were then randomly assigned to low sodium salt ( LSSalt ) or normal salt ( NSalt ) diets for 6 months . 
Their blood pressure was measured every 2 months . 
Serum plasma renin-angiotensin activity , blood biochemical assays and urinary measurements were determined at the baseline and at the end of the 6 months . 
At the end of the study , the mean systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) of the ISH LSSalt group had significantly decreased by 10.18 mm Hg ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 3.13 to 17.2 , P = .006 ) compared with that of the ISH NSalt group , while the mean SBP only decreased by 5.10 mm Hg ( 95 % CI : -2.02 to 12.2 , P = .158 ) in the NISH LSSalt group compared with that of the NISH NSalt group . 
The mean diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) had no significant differences in the ISH and NISH groups . 
No obvious renin angiotensin system activation was found after LSSalt intervention . 
Regarding the urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood biochemical assays , the LSSalt treatment had the same effects on the ISH group as on the NISH group . 
The present study showed that the SBP of ISH patients was significantly decreased with the LSSalt intervention , while neither the SBP of the NISH patients nor the DBP of either group were similarly decreased , which indicated that ISH patients were more sensitive to salt restriction . 
To determine the effects of exercise training on cardiopulmonary function and quality of life ( QOL ) in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who had completed surgery , radiotherapy , and/or chemotherapy with or without current hormone therapy use . 
Fifty-three postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to an exercise ( n = 25 ) or control ( n = 28 ) group . 
The exercise group trained on cycle ergometers three times per week for 15 weeks at a power output that elicited the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide . 
The control group did not train . 
The primary outcomes were changes in peak oxygen consumption and overall QOL from baseline to postintervention . 
Peak oxygen consumption was assessed by a graded exercise test using gas exchange analysis . 
Overall QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale . 
Fifty-two participants completed the trial . 
The exercise group completed 98.4 % of the exercise sessions . 
Baseline values for peak oxygen consumption ( P =.254 ) and overall QOL ( P =.286 ) did not differ between groups . 
Peak oxygen consumption increased by 0.24 L/min in the exercise group , whereas it decreased by 0.05 L/min in the control group ( mean difference , 0.29 L/min ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.18 to 0.40 ; P < .001 ) . 
Overall QOL increased by 9.1 points in the exercise group compared with 0.3 points in the control group ( mean difference , 8.8 points ; 95 % CI , 3.6 to 14.0 ; P =.001 ) . 
Pearson correlations indicated that change in peak oxygen consumption correlated with change in overall QOL ( r = 0.45 ; P < .01 ) . 
Exercise training had beneficial effects on cardiopulmonary function and QOL in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . 
This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial assessed the effects of epoetin alfa on transfusion requirements , hematopoietic parameters , quality of life ( QOL ) , and safety in anemic cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy . 
The study also explored a possible relationship between increased hemoglobin and survival . 
Three hundred seventy-five patients with solid or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies and hemoglobin levels < or = 10.5 g/dL , or greater than 10.5 g/dL but < or = 12.0 g/dL after a hemoglobin decrease of > or = 1.5 g/dL per cycle since starting chemotherapy , were randomized 2:1 to epoetin alfa 150 to 300 IU/kg ( n = 251 ) or placebo ( n = 124 ) three times per week subcutaneously for 12 to 24 weeks . 
The primary end point was proportion of patients transfused ; secondary end points were change in hemoglobin and QOL . 
The protocol was amended before unblinding to prospectively collect and assess survival data 12 months after the last patient completed the study . 
Epoetin alfa , compared with placebo , significantly decreased transfusion requirements ( P =.0057 ) and increased hemoglobin ( P < .001 ) . 
Improvement of all primary cancer- and anemia-specific QOL domains , including energy level , ability to do daily activities , and fatigue , was significantly ( P < .01 ) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients . 
Although the study was not powered for survival as an end point , Kaplan-Meier estimates showed a trend in overall survival favoring epoetin alfa ( P =.13 , log-rank test ) , and Cox regression analysis showed an estimated hazards ratio of 1.309 ( P =.052 ) favoring epoetin alfa . 
Adverse events were comparable between groups . 
Epoetin alfa safely and effectively ameliorates anemia and significantly improves QOL in cancer patients receiving nonplatinum chemotherapy . 
Encouraging results regarding increased survival warrant another trial designed to confirm these findings . 
To prospectively evaluate visual outcomes and complications during and after cataract surgery with or without prophylactic sclerostomy in nanophthalmic eyes with visually significant cataract.Sixty nanophthalmic eyes of 60 patients with visually significant cataract were randomly assigned to cataract surgery alone ( control group , n = 31 ) or cataract surgery with concomitant prophylactic sclerostomy ( sclerostomy group , n = 29 ) . 
Surgery was performed using phacoemulsification or manual small-incision cataract surgery ( SICS ) based on the LOCS III grading score . 
Group differences in intraoperative and postoperative complications were analyzed and risk factors assessed . 
Fewer complications were noted in eyes receiving sclerostomy ( 5/29 , 17.2 % ) as compared to control group eyes ( 12/31 , 38.7 % ) , though differences were marginally significant ( P = .065 ) . 
Four control group , but no sclerostomy group , eyes developed postoperative uveal effusions ( P = .04 ) . 
In multivariable models , sclerostomy decreased the odds of an intraoperative or postoperative complication by 80 % ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0.2 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 0.04-0.92 , P = .039 ) ; SICS was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications as compared to phacoemulsification ( OR = 5.95 , 95 % CI = 1.49-23.73 , P = .012 ) , while high preoperative intraocular pressure ( OR = 4.54 , 95 % CI = 0.99-20.9 , P = .052 ) and greater lens thickness ( OR = 3.38 , 95 % CI = 0.88-12.91 , P = .075 ) demonstrated a marginally significant association . 
Cataract surgery in eyes with nanophthalmos is associated with a high risk for vision-threatening complications . 
Performing a simultaneous prophylactic sclerostomy with cataract surgery reduces complication rates , particularly uveal effusions . 
Cataract surgery at earlier stages by phacoemulsification may be more beneficial than undergoing manual SICS . 
To investigate whether the relative dose-intensity of cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone ( CHOP ) chemotherapy could be improved by prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . 
Patients aged 65 to 90 years ( median , 72 years ) with stage II to IV aggressive NHL were randomly assigned to receive standard CHOP every 3 weeks or CHOP plus G-CSF every 3 weeks on days 2 to 11 of each cycle . 
In 389 eligible patients , the relative dose intensities ( RDIs ) of cyclophosphamide ( median , 96.3 % v 93.9 % ; P =.01 ) and doxorubicin ( median , 95.4 % v 93.3 % ; P =.04 ) were higher in patients treated with CHOP plus G-CSF . 
The complete response rates were 55 % and 52 % for CHOP and CHOP plus G-CSF , respectively ( P =.63 ) . 
The actuarial overall survival at 5 years was 22 % with CHOP alone , compared with 24 % with CHOP plus G-CSF ( P =.76 ) , with a median follow-up of 33 months . 
Patients treated with CHOP plus G-CSF had an identical incidence of infections , with World Health Organization grade 3 to 4 ( 34 of 1,191 cycles v 36 of 1,195 cycles ) . 
Only the cumulative days with antibiotics were fewer with CHOP plus G-CSF ( median , 0 v 6 days ; P =.006 ) than with CHOP alone . 
The number of hospital admissions and the number of days in hospital were not different . 
In elderly patients , G-CSF improved the RDI of CHOP , but this did not lead to a higher complete response rate or better overall survival . 
G-CSF did not prevent serious infections . 
The study was designed to compare the effects of treatment with a combination of trastuzumab ( Herceptin ; Genentech , Inc , South San Francisco , CA ) and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on health-related quality of life ( HRQL ) in patients with HER-2/neu overexpressing , metastatic breast cancer . 
A sample of 400 patients , not previously treated for metastatic disease and randomized to receive either trastuzumab plus chemotherapy ( 208 patients ) or chemotherapy alone ( 192 patients ) , completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment Care Quality of Life Questionnaire at baseline and on at least one subsequent occasion at 8 , 20 , 32 , 44 , and 56 weeks . 
HRQL improvement or worsening was defined as a > or= 10-point change ( range , 0 to 100 points ) in the scores of six preselected domains ( global quality of life [ QOL ] , physical , role , social , and emotional functioning , and fatigue ) . 
Stable HRQL was defined as a change of less than 10 . 
A Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing . 
After completion of chemotherapy , patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported significant improvement in fatigue ( P < .05 ) as compared with their baseline scores . 
Higher proportions of patients receiving the combined therapy achieved improvement in global QOL ( P < .05 ) than did patients treated with chemotherapy alone . 
Higher proportions of the combined therapy group also achieved improvement in physical and role functioning and in fatigue as compared with the chemotherapy group , but the differences were not statistically significant . 
There were no differences in the proportions of patients in the two groups that reported worsening . 
Statistically significantly higher proportions of patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy reported improved global QOL than did patients treated by chemotherapy alone . 
Pregnant women with an elevated viral load of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) have a risk of transmitting infection to their infants , despite the infants ' receiving hepatitis B immune globulin . 
In this multicenter , double-blind clinical trial performed in Thailand , we randomly assigned hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) -positive pregnant women with an alanine aminotransferase level of 60 IU or less per liter to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) or placebo from 28 weeks of gestation to 2 months post partum . 
Infants received hepatitis B immune globulin at birth and hepatitis B vaccine at birth and at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 months . 
The primary end point was a hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) -positive status in the infant , confirmed by the HBV DNA level at 6 months of age . 
We calculated that a sample of 328 women would provide the trial with 90 % power to detect a difference of at least 9 percentage points in the transmission rate ( expected rate , 3 % in the TDF group vs. 12 % in the placebo group ) . 
From January 2013 to August 2015 , we enrolled 331 women ; 168 women were randomly assigned to the TDF group and 163 to the placebo group . 
At enrollment , the median gestational age was 28.3 weeks , and the median HBV DNA level was 8.0 log10 IU per milliliter . 
Among 322 deliveries ( 97 % of the participants ) , there were 319 singleton births , two twin pairs , and one stillborn infant . 
The median time from birth to administration of hepatitis B immune globulin was 1.3 hours , and the median time from birth to administration of hepatitis B vaccine was 1.2 hours . 
In the primary analysis , none of the 147 infants ( 0 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 to 2 ) in the TDF group were infected , as compared with 3 of 147 ( 2 % ; 95 % CI , 0 to 6 ) in the placebo group ( P=0.12 ) . 
The rate of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups . 
The incidence of a maternal alanine aminotransferase level of more than 300 IU per liter after discontinuation of the trial regimen was 6 % in the TDF group and 3 % in the placebo group ( P=0.29 ) . 
In a setting in which the rate of mother-to-child HBV transmission was low with the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine in infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers , the additional maternal use of TDF did not result in a significantly lower rate of transmission . 
To evaluate the effects of continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) on nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injections ( MDI ) ; we also evaluated factors related to differences in hypoglycemia confidence in this population . 
Evaluations were performed from the GOLD randomized trial , an open-label multicenter crossover randomized clinical trial ( n = 161 ) over 69 weeks comparing CGM to self-measurement of blood glucose ( SMBG ) in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with MDI . 
Masked CGM and the hypoglycemia confidence questionnaire were used for evaluations . 
Time with nocturnal hypoglycemia , glucose levels < 70 mg/dL was reduced by 48 % ( 10.2 vs. 19.6 min each night , P < 0.001 ) and glucose levels < 54 mg/dL by 65 % . ( 3.1 vs. 8.9 min , P < 0.001 ) . 
For the corresponding glucose cutoffs , daytime hypoglycemia was reduced by 40 % ( 29 vs. 49 min , P < 0.001 ) and 54 % ( 8 vs. 18 min. , P < 0.001 ) , respectively . 
Compared with SMBG , CGM use improved hypoglycemia-related confidence in social situations ( P = 0.016 ) and confidence in more broadly avoiding serious problems due to hypoglycemia ( P = 0.0020 ) . 
Persons also reported greater confidence in detecting and responding to decreasing blood glucose levels ( thereby avoiding hypoglycemia ) during CGM use ( P = 0.0033 ) and indicated greater conviction that they could more freely live their lives despite the risk of hypoglycemia ( P = 0.022 ) . 
CGM reduced time in both nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with MDI and improved hypoglycemia-related confidence , especially in social situations , thus contributing to greater well-being and quality of life . 
To investigate risk factors associated with visual field progression in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study , a prospective trial designed to compare the effects of the alpha2-adrenergic agonist brimonidine tartrate 0.2 % to the beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol maleate 0.5 % on visual function in low-pressure glaucoma . 
Prospective cohort study . 
Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with ≥5 visual field tests during follow-up were included . 
Progression was determined using pointwise linear regression analysis , defined as the same 3 or more visual field locations with a slope more negative than -1.0 dB/year at P < 5 % , on 3 consecutive tests . 
Ocular and systemic risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model and further tested for independence in a multivariate model . 
A total of 253 eyes of 127 subjects ( mean age , 64.7 10.9 years ; mean follow-up , 40.6 12 months ) were analyzed . 
Eyes randomized to timolol progressed faster than those randomized to brimonidine ( mean rates of progression , -0.38 0.9 vs 0.02 0.7 dB/y , P < .01 ) . 
In the final multivariate model adjusting for all tested covariates , older age ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1.41/decade older , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] = 1.05 to 1.90 , P = .022 ) , use of systemic antihypertensives ( HR = 2.53 , 95 % CI = 1.32 to 4.87 , P = .005 ) , and mean ocular perfusion pressure ( HR = 1.21/mm Hg lower , 95 % CI = 1.12 to 1.31 , P < .001 ) were associated with progression whereas randomization to brimonidine revealed a protective effect ( HR = 0.26 , 95 % CI = 0.12 to 0.55 , P < .001 ) . 
While randomization to brimonidine 0.2 % was protective compared to timolol 0.5 % , lower mean ocular perfusion pressure increased the risk for reaching a progression outcome in the Low-pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study . 
This suggests that the beneficial effect of randomization to the brimonidine arm was independent of possible differences in ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatment arms . 
The current results and large number of drop-outs in the brimonidine 0.2 % arm suggest that more research is necessary before altering clinical practice paradigms .
