Yum! O

Serves O
really O
good O
sushi B-TARGET
. O

Not O
the O
biggest O
portions B-TARGET
but O
adequate. O

Green B-TARGET
Tea I-TARGET
creme I-TARGET
brulee I-TARGET
is O
a O
must! O

Don't O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
without O
it. O

No O
Comparison O

– O
I O
can't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

It O
has O
great O
sushi B-TARGET
and O
even O
better O
service B-TARGET
. O

The O
entire O
staff B-TARGET
was O
extremely O
accomodating O
and O
tended O
to O
my O
every O
need. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
with O
no O
complaints O
to O
date. O

Snotty O
Attitude O

– O
We O
were O
treated O
very O
rudely O
here O
one O
time O
for O
breakfast. O

The O
owner B-TARGET
is O
belligerent O
to O
guests O
that O
have O
a O
complaint. O

Good O
food B-TARGET
! O

– O
We O
love O
breakfast O
food. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
delicious O
meal B-TARGET
. O

We O
never O
had O
to O
wait O
more O
than O
5 O
minutes. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
is O
pretty O
friendly. O

The O
onion B-TARGET
rings I-TARGET
are O
great! O

They O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything. O

Overrated O

– O
I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
in O
the O
food B-TARGET
at O
Pagoda. O

The O
lemon B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
tasted O
like O
sticky O
sweet O
donuts O
and O
the O
honey B-TARGET
walnut I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
, O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
you.....were O
not O
good. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments. O

Nice O
ambience B-TARGET
, O
but O
highly O
overrated O
place B-TARGET
. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back. O

Worst O
Service B-TARGET
I O
Ever O
Had O

– O
A O
group O
of O
5 O
of O
us O
went O
there O
for O
Sunday O
brunch O
and O
sat O
outside. O

Everyone O
that O
sat O
in O
the O
back O
outside O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-TARGET
we O
had O
ever O
received. O

Our O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
non-existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-TARGET
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic. O

I O
will O
never O
return O
again. O

Fabulous O
Italian B-TARGET
Food I-TARGET
! O

– O
I O
highly O
recommend O
Mioposto B-TARGET
. O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
wonderful O
Italian B-TARGET
restaurant I-TARGET
in O
my O
neighborhood. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy. O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET

– O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
the O
amazing O
meal B-TARGET
, O
service B-TARGET
, O
and O
ambiance B-TARGET
I O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant. O

It O
was O
absolutely O
amazing. O

The O
wine B-TARGET
list I-TARGET
is O
incredible O
and O
extensive O
and O
diverse, O
the O
food B-TARGET
is O
all O
incredible O
and O
the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
all O
very O
nice, O
good O
at O
their O
jobs O
and O
cultured. O

I O
have O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

AMAZING. O

I O
cannot O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
again O
this O
coming O
weekend! O

Mmm... O
good! O

– O
Went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend. O

She O
had O
heard O
from O
a O
co-worker O
about O
this O
place. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
great! O

It's O
*very* O
reasonably O
priced, O
esp O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
perfect. O

We're O
going O
back. O
:D O

Finally O
a O
meal B-TARGET
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time! O

– O
In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-TARGET
and O
good O
service B-TARGET
, O
period. O

This O
is O
the O
place B-TARGET
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O
finest O
quality O
food B-TARGET
the O
industry O
can O
offer. O

Caution O
- O
its O
real O
food B-TARGET
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
best. O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
(like O
me) O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
(nothing O
wrong O
with O
that)- O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O
or O
some O
Ruby O
Tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it! O

If O
your O
looking O
for O
real O
quality O
(not O
the O
BS O
that O
is O
seen O
on O
yelp O
ratings O
- O
which O
allegedly O
recently O
got O
in O
trouble O
for O
"adjusting" O
ratings), O
you O
need O
to O
get O
in O
here! O

Very O
Disappointing O

– O
I O
took O
my O
parents O
here O
for O
their O
anniversary-very O
very O
disappointed!!! O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
very O
much O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-TARGET
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it. O

Rice B-TARGET
is O
too O
dry, O
tuna B-TARGET
wasn't O
so O
fresh O
either. O

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding. O

Very O
disappointed. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish B-TARGET
to O
be O
excellent. O

However, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-TARGET
are O
both O
severely O
lacking. O

Portions O
contain O
less O
fish O
than O
one O
would O
expect, O
particularly O
since O
prices O
are O
in O
line O
with O
the O
best O
sushi O
places O
in O
NYC O
(Masa O
excluded, O
of O
course). O

Furthermore, O
while O
the O
fish B-TARGET
is O
unquestionably O
fresh, O
rolls B-TARGET
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland. O

The O
service B-TARGET
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive. O

On O
a O
recent O
trip, O
our O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
extremely O
dismissive, O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-TARGET
members I-TARGET
waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
Japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby. O

We O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
($20+ O
per O
serving) O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price. O

But O
Im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake... O

Freshest O
sushi B-TARGET
– O
I O
love O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
to O
complex O
rolls B-TARGET
. O

The O
sashimi B-TARGET
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
I O
have O
ever O
tasted. O

Their O
apps B-TARGET
are O
all O
delicious. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions B-TARGET
are O
on O
the O
small O
side. O

But O
the O
space B-TARGET
is O
small O
and O
lovely, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
helpful. O

You O
are O
bound O
to O
have O
a O
very O
charming O
time. O

Not O
recommanded!!! O

– O
The O
food B-TARGET
was O
not O
great O
& O
the O
waiters B-TARGET
were O
rude. O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there!!! O

great O
service B-TARGET

– O
Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown. O

my O
service B-TARGET
was O
stellar! O

the O
bus B-TARGET
boy I-TARGET
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O
shaking O
a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me. O

food B-TARGET
was O
fine, O
with O
a O
some O
little-tastier-than-normal O
salsa B-TARGET
. O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
shouldn't O
be O
disappointed. O

Ok.... O
– O
Maybe O
I O
went O
in O
on O
someone's O
bad O
day.... O

the O
food B-TARGET
was O
great, O
the O
margaritas B-TARGET
too O
but O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
was O
too O
busy O
being O
nice O
to O
her O
other O
larger O
party O
than O
to O
take O
better O
care O
of O
my O
friend O
and O
me. O

Took O
forever O
to O
get O
our O
order O
taken, O
water O
refills O
were O
too O
much O
to O
ask O
for O
and O
the O
only O
time O
she O
was O
fast O
was O
when O
we O
asked O
for O
our O
bill O
when O
we O
could O
get O
her O
attention. O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
I'll O
be O
back.... O

Mama O
Mia O
– O
I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O
pizza B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
you O
really O
have O
to O
warm O
up O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
before O
it's O
edible, O
even O
when O
you O
order O
ahead. O

BUt O
once O
done, O
it's O
not O
too O
much O
dough, O
not O
too O
much O
cheese, O
not O
too O
much O
sauce. O

Best O
Sushi B-TARGET
in O
town. O

Have O
gone O
to O
all O
the O
top O
places. O

Everything O
you O
want O
and O
more, O
very O
fresh. O

Its O
worth O
the O
wait, O
especially O
since O
they'll O
give O
you O
a O
call O
when O
the O
table O
is O
ready. O

The O
best O
calamari B-TARGET
in O
Seattle! O

– O
...and O
the O
best O
summertime O
deck B-TARGET
experience--they O
will O
even O
bring O
you O
a O
blanket O
if O
you O
get O
cold O
in O
the O
Seattle O
evening O
weather. O

A O
perfect O
place B-TARGET
to O
take O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year. O

Endless O
fun, O
awesome O
music B-TARGET
, O
great O
staff B-TARGET
!!! O

– O
By O
far O
the O
best O
bar B-TARGET
in O
the O
east O
village... O

I O
went O
there O
with O
some O
friends O
one O
night O
to O
play O
bingo O
and O
watch O
the O
sox O
game O
and O
it O
was O
a O
blast! O

Every O
time O
"0-sixtynine" O
is O
called O
the O
bartender B-TARGET
buys O
everyone O
drinks! O

Been O
there O
lots O
since O
and O
its O
always O
a O
good O
time. O

Great O
draft B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
bottle I-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
and O
the O
pizza B-TARGET
rocks. O

Definitely O
has O
one O
of O
the O
best O
jukebox's B-TARGET
i've O
seen O
in O
a O
long O
long O
time. O

I O
FOUND O
A O
NEW O
HOME O
ON O
SECOND O
AVENUE!!!!!!!!!!!! O

– O
Where O
can O
I O
begin. O

I O
can't!!! O

Just O
go O
there O
and O
see O
for O
yourself. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great, O
the O
bartenders B-TARGET
go O
that O
extra O
mile. O

You O
need O
to O
watch O
your O
game, O
they O
will O
have O
it O
on O
for O
you. O

The O
owners B-TARGET
are O
great O
fun O
and O
the O
beer B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
is O
worth O
staying O
for. O

And O
the O
upstairs B-TARGET
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
hang O
out. O

Not O
alot O
of O
smoking O
places O
left O
in O
New O
York, O
but O
I O
have O
found O
my O
favorite O
smoking O
balconey B-TARGET
in O
the O
city. O

Kudos O
to O
these O
guys. O

I O
found O
a O
new O
home O
and O
just O
moved O
with O
a O
long O
lease. O

Thank O
you O

Go O
Beyond O
the O
California O
Rolls... O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
here O
is O
delicious! O

They O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
fish B-TARGET
and O
they O
even O
list O
which O
oceans O
they O
come O
from; O
Atlantic O
or O
Pacific. O

I've O
had O
the O
Jellyfish B-TARGET
, O
Horse B-TARGET
Mackerel I-TARGET
, O
Blue B-TARGET
Fin I-TARGET
Tuna I-TARGET
and O
the O
Sake B-TARGET
Ikura I-TARGET
roll I-TARGET
among O
others, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
good. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces B-TARGET
were O
a O
little O
bigger. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
is O
rustic, O
traditional O
Japanese. O

The O
crowd B-TARGET
is O
mixed O
yuppies, O
young O
and O
old. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
courteous O
and O
attentive. O

Mediocre O
food B-TARGET

– O
We O
ate O
on O
the O
outside O
patio O
area O
for O
dinner O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night. O

The O
outside O
patio O
area O
has O
an O
abbreviated O
menu B-TARGET
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
marinated O
grapes, O
buffalo O
style O
chicken O
wings, O
and O
the O
turkey O
sandwich. O

My O
g/f O
and O
I O
both O
agreed O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
mediocre O
especially O
considering O
the O
price. O

We O
are O
locals, O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place B-TARGET
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food B-TARGET
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
decent. O

Drinks B-TARGET
were O
good. O

Unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks B-TARGET
I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
going O
here. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed. O

Excellent O
food B-TARGET
, O
nice O
ambience B-TARGET
, O
fairly O
expensive O

– O
I O
loved O
the O
pumpkin B-TARGET
ravioli I-TARGET
and O
the O
goat B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
gnocchi I-TARGET
(5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O
plate O
instead O
of O
20 O
or O
so O
little O
gnocchis) O
and O
my O
sister O
loved O
her O
filet B-TARGET
mignon I-TARGET
on I-TARGET
top I-TARGET
of I-TARGET
spinach I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
mashed I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
. O

The O
ambiance B-TARGET
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney. O

It O
was O
romantic O
- O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister, O
reminded O
me O
of O
Italy, O
and O
had O
artwork B-TARGET
and O
music B-TARGET
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
Mediterrean O
villa. O

I O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge! O
(it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive) O

Best O
Indian B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
in O
L.A. O

– O
I've O
been O
to O
over O
a O
dozen O
Indian O
places O
in O
L.A., O
and O
this O
is O
still O
my O
favorite. O

The O
best O
thing O
is, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
quite O
reasonable. O

The O
chicken B-TARGET
curry I-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
tikka I-TARGET
masala I-TARGET
are O
my O
favorite O
meat O
dishes. O

The O
chana B-TARGET
masala I-TARGET
(garbanzo I-TARGET
beans) I-TARGET
are O
also O
excellent. O

It's O
located O
in O
a O
strip O
mall O
near O
the O
Beverly O
Center, O
not O
the O
greatest O
location B-TARGET
, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
keeps O
me O
coming O
back O
for O
more. O

hidden O
little O
jem O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center. O

Never O
too O
crowded O
and O
always O
great O
service B-TARGET
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
probably O
tried O
each O
item O
on O
their O
menu B-TARGET
at O
least O
once O
it O
is O
all O
excellent. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
their O
various O
saag B-TARGET
and O
paneer B-TARGET
and O
korma B-TARGET
. O

You O
routinely O
see O
Indian O
families O
and O
friends O
dining O
there, O
which O
is O
always O
a O
good O
sign. O

I O
appreciate O
their O
delivery B-TARGET
too. O

Nice O
food B-TARGET
but O
no O
spice! O

– O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
my O
meal B-TARGET
here. O

I O
had O
yummy O
lamb B-TARGET
korma I-TARGET
, O
saag B-TARGET
paneer I-TARGET
, O
samosas B-TARGET
, O
naan B-TARGET
, O
etc. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild. O

Normally, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it, O
but O
they O
didn't. O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food B-TARGET
to O
be O
that O
mild. O

I O
will O
give O
them O
another O
chance O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
kick O
it O
up O
several O
notches. O

The O
naan B-TARGET
was O
some O
of O

tomatoey. O

Even O
the O
chickpeas B-TARGET
, O
which O
I O
normally O
find O
too O
dry, O
were O
good. O

And O
they O
packaged O
everything O
nicely O
so O
it O
didn't O
spill. O

Lebanese B-TARGET
Food I-TARGET
!Yum! O

– O
I've O
been O
to O
Open B-TARGET
Sesame I-TARGET
only O
once, O
but O
I'm O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience!! O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
simply O
unforgettable! O

I O
had O
the O
beef O
kabobs O
with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O
yogurt. O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
an O
added O
bonus, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted! O

My O
best O
friend O
had O
the O
chicken B-TARGET
shawarma I-TARGET
and O
she O
STILL O
raves O
about O
it O
being O
the O
best O
anywhere! O

Her O
sister O
had O
the O
baklava O
for O
dessert! O

What O
a O
tastly, O
flaky O
treat! O

The O
staff B-TARGET
are O
friendly O
and O
the O
decor B-TARGET
was O
ethic O
and O
colorful. O

GO O
TO O
OPEN B-TARGET
SESAME I-TARGET
!!! O

Holy O
Hummus B-TARGET
! O

– O
The O
food B-TARGET
is O
here O
is O
incredible, O
though O
the O
quality O
is O
inconsistent O
during O
lunch B-TARGET
. O

Dinners B-TARGET
have O
always O
been O
excellent, O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
quality. O

The O
open B-TARGET
sesame I-TARGET
combo I-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
is O
a O
bargain O
for O
the O
heap O
of O
food O
given. O

The O
side B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
is O
to O
die O
for, O
as O
is O
the O
labne B-TARGET
(yogurt I-TARGET
dip) I-TARGET
. O

Also, O
they O
serve O
THE O
best O
hummus B-TARGET
in O
America, O
with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
(which, O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way)! O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating B-TARGET
and O
the O
slow O
service B-TARGET
. O

There O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we've O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we've O
ordered. O

However, O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
a O
gem, O
and O
I O
won't O
stop O
going O
back. O

great O
beer B-TARGET

– O
My O
first O
time O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
was O
with O
my O
son O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible! O

We O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
for O
our O
drinks O
and O
over O
1 O
1/2 O
hours O
for O
our O
food. O

I O
swore O
never O
to O
return O
for O
a O
warm O
beer B-TARGET
and O
mediocre O
meal B-TARGET
. O

HOWEVER, O
one O
Sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
did O
go O
(although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests) O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised. O

The O
band B-TARGET
was O
very O
good O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
attentive. O

Outside O
in O
the O
area O
between O
the O
restaurant O
and O
the O
park, O
children O
were O
running O
around O
while O
their O
parents O
sipped O
wine. O

We O
ordered O
a O
selection O
of O
the O
small O
plates, O
and O
the O
shoe B-TARGET
string I-TARGET
onions I-TARGET
, O
goat B-TARGET
cheese I-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
, O
grilled B-TARGET
asparagus I-TARGET
and O
fried B-TARGET
brie I-TARGET
with I-TARGET
fruit I-TARGET
were O
all O
very O
good. O

It O
was O
like O
dining O
at O
a O
completely O
different O
restaurant. O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-TARGET
( O
cold O
and O
good). O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-TARGET
the O
second O
time, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good. O

Sunday O
afternoons O
there O
is O
a O
band B-TARGET
playing O
and O
it O
is O
lots O
of O
fun. O

the O

. O

The O
sommelier B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
down-to-earth, O
& O
extremely O
knowlegable. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
for O
the O

Nice O

NOT O
THE O
PLACE B-TARGET
IT O
ONCE O
WAS O

– O
It O
is O
sad O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
was O
once O
"THE" O
place O
to O
meet O
and O
eat O
for O
Bfast O
or O
Lunch, O
now O
be O
the O
place B-TARGET
that O
is O
a O
big O
"DONT O
BOTHER." O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
( O
potions B-TARGET
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing) O
prices O
have O
gone O
up, O
and O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
(including O
mainland O
Europe). O

What O
may O
be O
interesting O
to O
most O
is O
the O
worst O
sevice/attitude O
comes O
from O
the O
owners B-TARGET
of O
this O
establishment. O

This O
establishment B-TARGET
really O
made O
a O
marked O
decline O
after O
( O
and O
this O
is O
recurring O
story O
) O
the O
airing O
of O
FOOD O
TELEVISIONS O
"DINERS, O
DRIVE-INS, O
AND O
DIVES" O
hosted O
by O
Guy O
Fieri, O
in O
which O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
was O
subject O
of. O

Perhaps O
now, O
Scooner B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
Later I-TARGET
falls O
into O
the O
"Dive" O
category. O

This O
is O
sad O
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat. O

I O
hope O
one O
day O
Scooner B-TARGET
or I-TARGET
Later I-TARGET
returns O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was. O

Untill O
this O
happens, O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
STAY O
AWAY. O

Great O

This O

charming O
and O
relaxing. O

The O
servers B-TARGET
behind I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
counter I-TARGET
are O
always O
friendly O
and O
helpful. O

It O
reminds O
me O
of O
those O
great O
little O
restaurants O
in O
San O
Francisco. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
enjoy O
food B-TARGET
and O
meet O
friends. O

Enjoyed O
the O
food B-TARGET

– O
First O
of O
all, O
I O
am O
not O
from O
Long O
Beach. O

I O
was O
visiting O
SoCal O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
when O
the O
friend O
I O
was O
visiting O
decided O
to O
take O
me O
to O
this O
restaurant. O

(She O
was O
actually O
going O
to O
take O
me O
to O
another O
mediterranean O
restaurant O
right O
across O
the O
street O
but O
they O
were O
not O
open O
yet O
even O
though O
it O
was O
a O
few O
minutes O
past O
their O
opening O
time.) O

I O
liked O
it. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
cheap. O

I O
had O
the O
kafta B-TARGET
plate I-TARGET
and O
I O
enjoyed O
it. O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious. O

Atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
nice. O

Service B-TARGET
was O
kind O
of O
slow, O
our O
waitress B-TARGET
took O
forever O
to O
give O
us O
our O
check O
even O
though O
it O
wasn't O
that O
busy. O

Still O
I O
would O
recommend O
this O
place B-TARGET
. O

BTW, O
I O
really O
like O
Long O
Beach. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O
SoCal O
where O
you O
would O
actually O
walk O
around O
and O
not O
have O
to O
take O
a O
car. O

WOW!!!!!!!! O

IT O

GET O

then O
take O
a O

nearby O
Farmer's O
Market. O

great O
meal B-TARGET
– O
the O
fish B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
omikase I-TARGET
platter I-TARGET
was O
absolutely O
decadent O
-- O
there O
was O
none O
of O
the O
stringiness O
that O
sometimes O
accompanies O
fair O
sushi O
-- O
this O
fish O
was O
perfect!!!! O

plus, O
i O
am O
allergic O
to O

and O
the O

was O
unbelievably O
accomodating O
-- O

even O

I O

This O
is O
right O
up O
there O
with O
places O
in O
Tokyo O
as O
far O
as O
the O
freshness O
is O
concerned. O

Melt O
in O
your O

On O
weekends, O
you O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
couple O
hours. O

However, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone O

so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere O
else O
till O
they O

– O
I O
can't O
believe O
Murphy's B-TARGET
has O
been O
around O
for O
over O
25 O
years, O
amazing. O

That's O
a O
huge O
compliment, O
especially O
in O
the O
fickled O
restaurant O
business, O
...enough O
already! O

– O
Best O
Mexican B-TARGET
place I-TARGET
for O
lunch O
in O
the O
financial O

Love O
the O
enchiladas B-TARGET
and O
chicken B-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
- O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
check O
out O
their O
specials B-TARGET
. O

The O
cooks B-TARGET
have O
been O
at O
the O
restaurant O
for O
years O
and O
cook O
family O
recipes. O

Can O
get O
busy O
on O
Fridays O
for O
a O
table O
but O
once O
seated, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
so O
efficient O
you O
can O
be O
in O
and O
out O
of O
there O
quickly. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
friend O
from O
out O
of O
town... O
and O
we O
were O
both O
very O
impressed! O

Went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
wait O
for O
a O
table. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
was O
quick. O

The O
price O
was O
right O
too. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
just O
okay. O

Space B-TARGET
was O
limited, O
but O
the O
food B-TARGET
made O
up O
for O
it. O

I'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat. O

Should O
have O
gone O
to O
Trader O
Joe's O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
:( O

– O
My O
family O
went O
on O
a O
midweek O
evening O
to O
have O
dinner. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
80 O
% O
full O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sign O
posted O
"wait O
to O
be O
seated." O

Well O
I O
guess O
it's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff B-TARGET
. O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees B-TARGET
walked O
back O
and O
forth O
ignoring O
us. O

Finally, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff B-TARGET
and O
she O
asked, O
"Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table?" O

Once O
seated O
it O
took O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
get O
the O
meal. O

The O
prior O
reviews O
said O
Kid O
friendly... O
give O
me O
a O
break O
with O
two O
young O
children O
that O
is O
light O
years. O

The O
Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
I O
ordered O
had O
so O
much O
lemon O
I O
couldn't O
eat O
it. O

The O
pizza O
was O
slightly O
reminescent O
of O
Baker's O
Beach O
pizza O
which O
occupied O
the O
the O
space O
years O
ago O
(a O
distant O
second). O

It O
was O
decent O
but O
nothing O
exceptional. O

This O
establishment O
is O
consistent O
with O
my O
feelings O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Chow O
Foods O
group. O

We O
used O
to O
frequent O
most O
of O
their O
restaurants O
but O
over O
the O
years O
each O
one O
has O
really O
been O
disapointing. O

I'm O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening. O

Well, O
I O
guess O
maybe O
it O
might O
be O
beneficial O
for O
the O
management O
to O
pay O
a O
visit O
to O
Tutta O
Bella O
in O
Columbia O
City O
for O
some O
tips. O

Great O

For O
the O

there's O
a O
nice O

of O
traditional O

as O
well. O

The O
nicest O
waiters B-TARGET
in O
town. O

WAY O
OVER-RATED!!!! O

– O
This O
place B-TARGET
is O
unbelievably O
over-rated. O

If O
I O
want O
to O
stand O
in O
line O
on O
Sunday O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
average O
brunch B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
, O
then O
I O
would O
put O
Murphy's O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
list. O

The O
regular B-TARGET
menu I-TARGET
here O
is O
slightly O
above O

that O
is O
not O

the O

Believe O
it O
baby! O

Cut O
to O
the O
chase O
- O
this O
is O
amazing! O

It's O
unpretentious O
and O
underground. O

It's O
fresh, O
welcoming, O
delicious, O
and O
relaxing. O

Hands O
down, O
the O
best O
tuna B-TARGET
I O
have O
ever O
had. O

Blue B-TARGET

lives O
up O
to O
it's O
fantastic O
reputation. O

I O
went O
here O
on O
a O
recommendation O
and O
will O
surely O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again. O

What O
a O
find! O

Well O
worth O
it O

Great O
value O
sushi B-TARGET
with O
high O
quality O
& O
nice O
setting B-TARGET
. O

Good O
for O
late O
night O
dining O
(last O
minute O
planning) O
without O
reservations. O

Try O
the O
Chef's B-TARGET
Choice I-TARGET
for I-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
as O
the O
smoked B-TARGET
yellowtail I-TARGET
was O
incredible O
and O
the O
rolls B-TARGET
were O
also O
tasty. O

Poor O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
/poor O
pizza B-TARGET
. O

– O
As O
with O
most O
restaurants O
in O
Seattle, O
Mioposto's O
service B-TARGET
was O
bad O
and O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
overpriced. O

I O
know O
many O
people O
have O
their O
favorite O
types O
of O
pizza O
and O
pizza O
places, O
but O
Mioposto's O
pizza B-TARGET
lacks O
quality O
and O
good O
taste. O

To O
be O
honest, O
I've O
had O
better O
frozen O
pizza B-TARGET
. O

I'm O
not O
kidding. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto B-TARGET
is O
the O
nice O
location B-TARGET
. O

Love O
it O
every O
time O

I O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
I O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
- O
this O
place B-TARGET
is O
fantastic; O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way, O
and O
we've O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times. O

People O
complain O
about O
the O
dim O
lighting, O
but O
that O
is O
one O
what O
I O
love O
about O
this O
place O
- O
if O
you O
want O
to O
stare O
at O
your O
food O
in O
bright O
light, O
go O
to O
McDonalds. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
and O
the O
waiting B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
has O
been O
perfect O
every O
single O
time O
we've O
been O
there. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait B-TARGET
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
waiting. O

Never O
had O
one O
single O
problem O
there. O

Seafood B-TARGET
Plus O

– O
This O
was O
great O
dining O
experience. O

If O
you're O
going O
to O
see O
Danny O
Gans O
or O
just O
staying O
at O
the O
Mirage, O
don't O
miss O
this O
one. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
oysters, I-TARGET
lobster, I-TARGET
crab I-TARGET
(small I-TARGET
size) I-TARGET
made O
a O
perfect O
entre O
for O
my O
wife. O

Seabass B-TARGET
on I-TARGET
lobster I-TARGET
risotto I-TARGET
was O
the O
best. O

Caesar B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
was O
superb. O

Great O
bottle B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
. O

Leave O
room O
for O
dessert B-TARGET
. O

COMPLETELY O
OVER O
RATED! O

I O
will O
have O
to O
do O
more O
research O
before O
checking O
out O
new O
places O
based O
on O
Diners, O
drive-ins O
and O
dives O
reviews. O

I O
noice O
most O
reviews O
mention O
the O
bad O
service. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
ok, O
but O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food O
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served. O

Even O
then, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
correct O
and O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
couple O
items. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress B-TARGET
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner B-TARGET
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill. O

When O
the O
bill O
came, O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks. O

It O
was O
clear O
he O
didn’t O
really O
care. O

With O
so O
many O
great O
breakfast/lunch O
places O
in O
So O
Cal, O
this O
one O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
any O
extra O
effort O
to O
visit. O

AVOID O
THE O
PLACE B-TARGET

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit. O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
horrible! O

I O
waited O
for O
10-15 O
minutes O
for O
service B-TARGET
ordered O
a O
beer O
& O
was O
never O
served O
again. O

After O
sitting O
there O
with O
my O
empty O
glass O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
I O
left. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
doesn't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link. O

I O
never O
heard O
back O
from O
anyone O
more O
than O
a O
month O
ago. O

After O
telling O
my O
friend O
about O
the O
situation O
he O
said O
lets O
try O
again O
but O
we O
will O
visit O
the O
lower O
bar. O

After O
sitting O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
the O
bar B-TARGET
keep I-TARGET
had O
made O
only O
2 O
drinks O
& O
kept O
telling O
us O
she'd O
be O
right O
with O
us. O

We O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service B-TARGET
. O

As O
of O
writing O
this O
I O
just O
tried O
their O
give O
away O
a O
link O
again O
& O
it O
still O
doesn't O
work. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
better O
places O
to O
visit! O

Best O
Crab B-TARGET
Cakes I-TARGET
in O
Town O

– O
Thats O
a O
big O
statement O
considering O
I've O
been O
pulling O
crab O
traps O
and O
making O
the O
cakes B-TARGET
myself O
since O
I O
was O
about O
seven O
- O
but O
something O
about O
these O
little O
devils O
gets O
better O
every O
time. O

If O
you O
can, O
come O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET
by O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
a O
whole O
evening. O

Great O
seasonal B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
and O
seafood B-TARGET
, O
with O
a O
classy O
waterfront B-TARGET
setting I-TARGET
. O

Always O
a O
winner. O

Great O
Pizza B-TARGET
, O
Poor O
Service B-TARGET

– O
Love O
their O
pizza B-TARGET
, O
especially O
the O
mushroom B-TARGET
pizza I-TARGET
. O

Also O
love O
their O
caeser B-TARGET
salad I-TARGET
. O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
the O
servers B-TARGET
, O
one O
young B-TARGET
woman I-TARGET
in O
particular. O

She O
doesn't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance. O

But O
she O
is O
very O
friendly O
with O
certain O
people, O
making O
it O
even O
more O
annoying. O

Management B-TARGET
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff B-TARGET
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza B-TARGET
and O
poor O
service B-TARGET
, O
so O
it O
can't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers. O

It's O
a O
great O
little O
place B-TARGET
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service B-TARGET
weren't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like. O

Great O
Breakfast B-TARGET

– O
This O
place O
is O
famous O
for O
their O
breakfast B-TARGET
. O

They O
have O
been O
featured O
on O
the O
food O
network O
and O
they O
deserve O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
great O
and O
they O
make O
a O
mean O
bloody B-TARGET
mary I-TARGET
. O

I O
love O
breakfast B-TARGET
here. O

Their O
crab B-TARGET
eggs I-TARGET
benedict I-TARGET
is O
addicting. O

All O
their O
menu B-TARGET
items I-TARGET
are O
a O
hit, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas. O

Doesn't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that. O

best O
chinese B-TARGET
food I-TARGET
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

– O
we O
got O
a O
groupon O
for O
pagoda O
and O
decided O
to O
try O
it O
on O
a O
thursday O
night. O

there O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
the O
piano O
and O
singing O
at O
the O
bar O
area O
which O
was O
separate O
from O
the O
dinning O
area. O

You O
can O
easily O
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
and O
not O
overbearing. O

the O
ambiance B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning. O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up. O

the O
staff B-TARGET
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese. O

we O
ordered O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
which O
we O
always O
order O
at O
every O
chinese O
restaurant O
to O
determine O
the O
quality O
of O
food. O

First O
off, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
:) O
i O
like O
that... O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other. O

so O
about O
the O
prawns B-TARGET
, O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter B-TARGET
... O
soooo O
good... O
the O
walnuts B-TARGET
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty. O

yummy. O

best O
honey B-TARGET
walnyt I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted. O

next O
one O
that O
we O
ordered O
were O
prawns O
and O
scallop O
with O
brocolli. O

the O
brocollis B-TARGET
were O
so O
fresh O
and O
tasty. O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli B-TARGET
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time, O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one... O
the O
scallops B-TARGET
and O
prawns B-TARGET
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked. O

not O
chewy O
at O
all. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango B-TARGET
ginger I-TARGET
creme I-TARGET
brulee I-TARGET
... O
oh O
la O
la O
yummy!!! O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth. O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
. O

every O
month O
if O
possible. O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel... O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
dont O
want O
to O
miss, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose. O

Chintzy O
portions B-TARGET

– O
The O
sushi B-TARGET
here O
is O
perfectly O
good, O
but O
for O
$5 O
a O
piece, O
either O
the O
slices O
of O
fish O
should O
be O
larger, O
or O
there O
should O
be O
no O
pretense O
that O
this O
is O
a O
moderately O
priced O
restaurant B-TARGET
(even O
for O
NYC). O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$40 O
per O
person O
(not O
including O
alcohol) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry. O

I'm O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant B-TARGET
is O
categorized O
as O
$$$ O
rather O
than O
$$$$. O

Terrible O
service B-TARGET
, O
food B-TARGET
ok, O
pricey O

– O
This O
past O
weekend O
had O
great O
weather O
for O
San O
Francisco O
standards. O

So O
for O
the O
'after O
beach O
excursion', O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
busy, O
however O
there O
were O
a O
few O
tables O
open. O

We O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it'd O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait. O

So O
here O
we O
are, O
my O
wife, O
3 O
year O
old O
daughter O
and O
I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
building O
(where O
the O
murals O
and O
artifacts O
are). O

30 O
minutes O
went O
by O
and O
sure O
enough O
the O
pager O
buzzer O
went O
off. O

We O
went O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
low O
and O
behold, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
that O
was O
available O
30 O
minutes O
ago!! O

Logic O
behind O
that? O

None O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of. O

We O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers, O
the O
food O
didn't O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
later...WITH O
OUR O
MAIN O
COURSE. O

Um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for??? O

Oh O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
don't O
have O
bread O
service. O

Its O
a O
good O
thing O
my O
daughter O
had O
some O
snacks O
in O
her O
lunch O
bag. O

My O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
(she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat) O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water, O
it O
wasn't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it. O

In O
other O
words, O
if O
they O
aren't O
making O
$$ O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
don't O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
' O
service B-TARGET
scale'. O

Food B-TARGET
wise, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place. O

The O
upside O
of O
the O
restaurant? O

If O
I O
needed O
to O
name O
some O
they O
would O
include O
the O
location B-TARGET
to O
the O
beach O
or O
Golden O
Gate O
park. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat. O

Parking O
is O
reasonably O
good, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby. O

Another O
plus O
is O
the O
open O
feel B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
with O
glass B-TARGET
walls I-TARGET
on O
all O
sides. O

I'd O
hate O
for O
tourists O
to O
go O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
and O
think O
that O
this O
is O
how O
all O
San O
Francisco O
restaurants O
are O
like. O

Always O
good. O

– O
A O
sushi-fiend O
friend O
recently O
visited O
and O
our O
group O
of O
three O
just O
had O
to O
come O
for O
dinner. O

6pm O
on O
a O
Sat O
before O
a O
Broadway O
play O
and O
we O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
served. O

Amazing O
Spanish B-TARGET
Mackeral I-TARGET
special I-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
and O
perfect O
box B-TARGET
sushi I-TARGET
(that O
eel B-TARGET
with I-TARGET
avodcao I-TARGET
-- O
um O
um O
um). O

As O
usual O
the O
omikase B-TARGET
didn't O
disappoint O
in O
freshness, O
although O
it O
scored O
low O
on O
creativity O
and O
selection. O

Their O
specialty B-TARGET
rolls I-TARGET
are O
impressive, O
though O
I O
can't O
remember O
what O
we O
had. O

Great O
selection B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
sakes I-TARGET
. O

Green B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
creme I-TARGET
brulee I-TARGET
gets O
better O
each O
time O
I O
have O
it. O

It O
isn't O
the O
cheapest O
sushi B-TARGET
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time. O

Very O
poor O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
. O

– O
Schooner O
or O
Later's O
charming O
location B-TARGET
along I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
marina I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
Long I-TARGET
Beach I-TARGET
and O
average O
food B-TARGET
does O
not, O
unfortunately, O
compensate O
for O
its O
very O
poor O
customer B-TARGET
service I-TARGET
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food B-TARGET
, O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment; O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table. O

When O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down, O
it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O
person O
who O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
food, O
who O
was O
also O
not O
the O
same O
person O
who O
had O
taken O
our O
order. O

After O
one O
member O
of O
our O
party O
had O
been O
bumped O
repeatedly O
by O
a O
waitress B-TARGET
, O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
he O
not O
be O
bumped O
sent O
the O
waitress O
into O
an O
abusive O
rant. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-TARGET
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment--to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
"blown O
off" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement. O

The O
manager B-TARGET
continually O
interrupted O
with O
"Is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
can O
do O
for O
you?", O
a O
strange O
comment O
because O
she O
had O
hardly O
listened, O
let O
alone O
responded O
to O
our O
expression O
of O
disappointment O
at O
our O
experience. O

She O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously, O
seeing O
as O
she O
hadn't O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name. O

In O
short, O
Schooner O
or O
Later O
couldn't O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment. O

Next O
time O
we O
will O
go O
somewhere O
else, O
or O
try O
other O
restaurants O
close O
by O
like O
Mimi's O
Cafe O
and O
Claim O
Jumper. O

1 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning. O

you O
are O
with O
a O
hot O
date O
and O
he/she O
has O
an O
urge O
for O
sushi B-TARGET
...then O
this O
might O
be O
the O
place. O

the O
fish B-TARGET
was O
fresh, O
though O
it O
was O
cut O
very O
thin. O

great O

– O

for O
high O
quality O

And O
they O
give O
good O
quantity O
for O
the O
price. O

We O
were O
only O
in O
Seattle O
for O
one O
night O
and O
I'm O
so O
glad O
we O
picked O
Rays B-TARGET
for O
dinner! O

I O
love O
Dungeness B-TARGET
crabs I-TARGET
and O
at O
Ray's O
you O
can O
get O
them O
served O
in O
about O
6 O
different O
ways! O

We O
shared O
the O
family O
platter O
and O
I O
especially O
enjoyed O
the O
black B-TARGET
cod I-TARGET
in I-TARGET
sake I-TARGET
kasu I-TARGET
. O

I O
ended O
the O
meal O
with O
the O
unusual O
dessert B-TARGET
of I-TARGET
a I-TARGET
port I-TARGET
and I-TARGET
chocolate I-TARGET
tasting I-TARGET
....yummy! O

And O
the O
service B-TARGET
was O
simply O
spendid O
- O
quite O
a O
delight. O

– O
Every O

In O

The O

Good O
Food B-TARGET
, O
Great O
Service B-TARGET
, O
Average O
Prices O
(For O
the O
Strip) O

– O
I O
decided O
to O
eat O
at O
Stack O
because O
of O
their O
price B-TARGET
fixed I-TARGET
pre-show I-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
. O

When O
I O
walked O
in, O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
by O
their O
incredible O
wood B-TARGET
decor I-TARGET
. O

The O
music B-TARGET
playing O
was O
very O
hip, O
20-30 O
something O
pop O
music, O
but O
the O
subwoofer B-TARGET
to I-TARGET
the I-TARGET
sound I-TARGET
system I-TARGET
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner. O

We O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
requested O
the O
special O
dinner, O
which O
came O
with: O
1) O
Shellfish O
and O
Shrimp O
appetizer O
or O
Caesar O
Salad, O
2) O
9 O
oz O
steak O
(with O
a O
single O
potato O
chip), O
and O
3) O
homemade O
donut O
holes. O

I O
got O
the O
shellfish B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
shrimp I-TARGET
appetizer I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
alright. O

It O
wasn't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-TARGET
ever, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK. O

Before O
the O
steak O
came, O
the O
server O
told O
us O
that O
the O
steak O
did O
not O
come O
with O
any O
sides O
and O
suggested O
I O
pick O
something O
from O
the O
menu. O

I O
picked O
the O
asparagus B-TARGET
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incredible O
and O
perfectly O
prepared. O

It O
was O
steamed O
and O
tossed O
with O
garlic. O

The O
9 B-TARGET
oz I-TARGET
steak I-TARGET
came O
next O
and O
it O
tasted O
great, O
at O
least O
initially. O

The O
steak B-TARGET
was O
done O
to O
my O
exact O
liking O
(medium O
rare) O
and O
was O
nice O
and O
juicy. O

It?s O
served O
with O
either O
a O
peppercorn B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
or O
red B-TARGET
wine I-TARGET
reduction I-TARGET
, O
though O
both O
were O
indistinguishable O
in O
taste. O

Though, O
one O
thing O
I O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
MSG O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak B-TARGET
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
?MSG? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant. O

Finally, O
the O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
were O
served O
for O
desert. O

They O
came O
in O
their O
own O
nifty O
take O
out O
box O
and O
with O
some O
homemade O
frosting; O
very O
light O
and O
not-too-sweet. O

The O
desert B-TARGET
was O
the O
perfect O
ending O
to O
an O
almost O
perfect O
dinner B-TARGET
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip, O
almost O
$50/pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
(about O
average). O

But O
the O
servers B-TARGET
were O
extremely O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly. O

Overall, O
I O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant B-TARGET
again. O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban-chic O
so O
you O
don?t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O
place. O

good O
sake B-TARGET
, O
good O
food B-TARGET
– O
i O
honestly O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
japanese O
food O
at O
all. O

In O
the O
past O
sake O
usuallly O
just O
tasted O
kind O
of O
like O
salty O
water O
to O
me. O

Server B-TARGET
made O
several O
sake B-TARGET
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good. O

had O
many O
dishes O
but O
the O
BEST O
was O
the O
lobster B-TARGET
3 I-TARGET
ways I-TARGET
. O

VERY O
GOOD! O

Overpriced O

– O
We O
dined O
at O
the O
Colorado O
location O
today. O

Waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok O
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd. O

The O
waiter B-TARGET
was O
a O
bit O
unfriendly O
and O
the O
feel B-TARGET
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
crowded. O

Also, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bathroom B-TARGET
stall I-TARGET
- O
probably O
need O
more O
for O
such O
big O
crowds. O

Most O
importantly, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food O
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu B-TARGET
. O

At O
best, O
the O
food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced. O

For O
the O
amount O
of O
food B-TARGET
we O
got O
the O
prices O
should O
have O
been O
lower. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back. O

My O
favortie O
pizza B-TARGET
joint I-TARGET
in O
Seattle O

– O
This O
is O
my O
"must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to" O
restaurant B-TARGET
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it. O

In O
fact, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
salads B-TARGET
are O
fantastic. O

I've O
always O
found O
the O
wait B-TARGET
staff I-TARGET
and, O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar, O
the O
cooks B-TARGET
very O
friendly. O

They O
aren't O
the O
most O
talkative, O
but O
everytime O
I've O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy, O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation. O

I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor B-TARGET
and O
intimate O
feeling B-TARGET
of O
a O
small O
restaurant. O

It's O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu. O

Excellent O

– O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
love O

Mioposto B-TARGET
Café I-TARGET

We’re O
can’t O
say O
enough O
about O
their O
delicious O
gourmet O
pizza’s B-TARGET
! O

You O
won’t O
be O
disappointed O
by O
their O
menu B-TARGET
. O

The O
pizza’s B-TARGET
are O
thin O
crust O
and O
the O
menu B-TARGET
offers O
very O
creative O
combinations O
and O
toppings. O

You O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there. O

The O
pizza’s B-TARGET
are O
light O
and O
scrumptious. O

Try O
the O
Pizza B-TARGET
Ensalata I-TARGET
! O

It’s O
a O
salad O

crust. O

Absolutely O
delicious. O

The O
pizza’s B-TARGET
are O
not O
huge O
and O
the O
crust B-TARGET
is O
thin…keep O
that O
in O
mind O
when O
you’re O
ordering. O

Worth O
the O
wait O

– O
Had O
to O
wait O
thirty O
minutes O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door O
on O
a O
tuesday O
morning, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
worth O
it. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
sinful. O

The O
staff B-TARGET
was O
really O
friendly. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
was O
great. O

The O
specialty O
here O
is O
decadent O
pancakes B-TARGET
, O
but O
I've O
been O
back O
now O
four O
times, O
and O
I've O
been O
wowed O
every O
time. O

Nothing O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
less O
than O
amazing. O

Go O
with O
some O
friends, O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe, O
and O
enjoy O
more O
than O
your O
average O
breakfast B-TARGET
. O

Good O

Whose O
writing O
all O

Why O
is O
it O
that O
(almost) O
every O

I O
don't O

why O
anyone O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place B-TARGET

folks O
and O
it O
is O
BAD. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-TARGET

half-way O
decent. O

I O
have O
been O
here, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef B-TARGET
special I-TARGET
dinner I-TARGET
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment. O

Fancy O
pieces O
of O
exotic B-TARGET
fish I-TARGET
on O
a O
$100 O
dollar O
plate B-TARGET
and O
NOT O
ONE O
was O
eatable. O

DONOT O
GO! O

Delicious O

– O
The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
great O
for O
any O

you O

The O
best O

are O
the O

food B-TARGET
was O
outstanding. O

It O
was O
worth O
the O
wait. O

Plan O
on O
waiting O
30-70 O
minutes. O

Will O
definitely O
be O
back. O

Southglenn O
is O
largest O
location. O

Delicious...! O

– O
I O
recently O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
dining O
as O
this O
delightful O
restaurant B-TARGET
on O
2nd O
street O
and O
wow O
what O
a O
great O
evening O
we O
had. O

The O
food B-TARGET
is O
fantastic, O
authentic, O
delicious O
and O
very, O
very O
affordable. O

The O
decor B-TARGET
was O
beautiful O
and O
unique. O

There O
was O
a O
really O
nice O
vibe B-TARGET
about O
the O
place...good O
music B-TARGET
, O
atmosphere B-TARGET
and O
happy O
looking O
people B-TARGET
. O

Our O
server B-TARGET
was O
very O
professional O
and O
friendly. O

To O
the O
owners O
of O
Open B-TARGET
Sesame I-TARGET
...Bravo...I O
can't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
to O
dine O
at O
your O
restaurant! O

Delectable O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place B-TARGET
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8pm O
on O
a O
weekend O
(Thurs?Sun) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar. O

Once O
you're O
inside, O
the O
real O
experience O
begins. O

Everything, O
and O
I O
mean O
everything O
on O
the O
menu B-TARGET
is O
delectable. O

The O
waiters B-TARGET
are O
very O
experienced O
and O
helpful O
with O
pairing O
your O
drink O
choice O
to O
your O
food O
tastes O
or O
vice O
versa. O

The O
sushi B-TARGET
is O
as O
fresh O
as O
it O
comes?you'd O
think O
ocean O
was O
in O
their O
backyard, O
no O
joke! O

If O
you're O
interested O
in O
good O
tasting O
(without O
the O
fish O
taste O
or O
smell), O
large O
portions B-TARGET
and O
creative O
sushi B-TARGET
dishes I-TARGET
this O
is O
your O
place... O

big O
thick O
pepperoni B-TARGET

– O
The O
pepperoni's B-TARGET
cut O
real O
thick--Yum. O

The O
pizza B-TARGET
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
EVER, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good. O

I O
probably O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
though O
'cuz O
I O
don't O
know O
if O
it's O
worth O
it. O

Maybe O
I'll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
I've O
forgotten O
I O
went O
there O
already. O

Sit O
in O
the O
Balcony B-TARGET

– O
Not O
bad. O

Food B-TARGET
was O
good O
and O
appetizing. O

Portions B-TARGET
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me, O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater. O

Fair O
menu B-TARGET
selection I-TARGET
. O

The O
appetizer B-TARGET
was O
interesting, O
but O
the O
Creme B-TARGET
Brulee I-TARGET
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious. O

Indoor B-TARGET
ambience I-TARGET
was O
modern. O

If O
it's O
nice O
outside, O
request O
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
balcony B-TARGET
. O

It's O
a O
great O
place B-TARGET
to O
people O
watch. O

Although O
the O
service B-TARGET
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in. O

Our O
drinks O
kept O
coming O
but O
our O
server B-TARGET
came O
by O
a O
couple O
times. O

Should O
check-up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently, O
don't O
you O
think? O

Late O
night O
dinning O
with O
exeptional O
food B-TARGET
. O

– O
I O
didn't O
want O
to O
go O
there O
because O
of O
the O
reviews O
and O
prices O
I O
saw O
on O
the O
internet. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place. O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away, O
the O
table B-TARGET
was O
private O
and O
nice. O

The O
service B-TARGET
was O
exceptional O
- O
sometime O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
army O
of O
friendly O
waiters B-TARGET
. O

The O
food B-TARGET
was O
very O
good, O
filet B-TARGET
mignon I-TARGET
was O
probably O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
try. O

The O
portions B-TARGET
are O
big O
though, O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much. O

Groovy O
music B-TARGET
made O
the O
dinner O
casual. O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places. O

I O
have O
a O
but O
here O
- O
there O
was O
a O
bathroom O
attendant O
in O
the O
restroom B-TARGET
which O
was O
odd. O

The O
bathroom B-TARGET
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O
towels O
from O
the O
dispenser. O

There O
were O
3 O
bottles O
of O
perfume O
on O
the O
sink O
and O
the O
line O
of O
girls O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
sink. O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom. O

This O
place B-TARGET
rocks!! O

– O
Mercedes O
restaurant O
is O
so O
tasty, O
the O
service B-TARGET
is O
undeniably O
awesome! O

The O
chips B-TARGET
and I-TARGET
salsa I-TARGET
are O
so O
yummy, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
fabulous. O

The O
atmosphere B-TARGET
is O
aspiring, O
and O
the O
decor B-TARGET
is O
festive O
and O
amazing.. O

The O
catering B-TARGET
is O
out O
of O
this O
world, O
and O
Raouls B-TARGET
chicken I-TARGET
vegetable I-TARGET
soup I-TARGET
rocks O
my O
world!!! O

Drinks B-TARGET
are O
suberb, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
in O
a O
Third O
World O
country O
when O
I O
walk O
in O
the O
door. O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

- O
Mediocre O
Service B-TARGET
/Quality O

– O
This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen O
location O
which O
is O
not O
listed O
in O
Citysearch: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference O
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed O
by O
management O
but O
Snooze O
has O
people O
climbing O
over O
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food O
and O
service, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative O
ones O
for O
their O
Larimer O
location O
will O
go O
unaddressed. O

The O
presentation O
of O
Snooze B-TARGET
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O
overpriced O
IHOP O
with O
a O
high O
brow O
menu B-TARGET
. O

To O
start O
off, O
approximately O
8-10 O
oz O
of O
orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
will O
cost O
you O
$3. O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall, O
skinny O
hour-glass O
shaped O
glass O
to O
disguise O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small O
juice B-TARGET
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that; O
but O
their O
menu B-TARGET
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued. O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
were O
certainly O
inventive O
but O
$8.50 O
for O
3 O
- O
6" O
pancakes O
(one O
of O
them O
was O
more O
like O
5") O
in O
the O
pancake O
flight O
(sample O
of O
3 O
different O
pancakes) O
is O
well O
over-priced. O

The O
pancakes B-TARGET
should O
be O
larger O
(at O
least O
8") O
to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O
offerings. O

The O
flavors O
were O
good O
but O
I O
have O
had O
far O
better O
pancakes O
at O
a O
German O
pancake O
specialty O
restaurant O
that O
were O
a O
little O
cheaper O
but O
significantly O
larger. O

On O
my O
meal B-TARGET
I O
had O
to O
send O
back O
my O
eggs B-TARGET
for O
a O
simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O
yokes O
before O
cooking, O
and O
would O
have O
had O
to O
send O
them O
back O
again O
if O
I O
hadn't O
rejected O
the O
meal O
all O
together. O

I O
rejected O
it O
because O
in O
the O
process O
of O
attempting O
to O
fix O
the O
eggs O
they O
broke O
something O
else O
in O
the O
dish B-TARGET
and O
I O
was O
too O
frustrated O
to O
continue. O

To O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check; O
but O
no O
manager B-TARGET
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O
problem O
was. O

In O
the O
end O
our O
check O
came O
to O
$27 O
for O
4 O
small O
pancakes B-TARGET
, O
a O
breakfast B-TARGET
burrito I-TARGET
, O
an O
orange B-TARGET
juice I-TARGET
and O
an O
iced B-TARGET
tea I-TARGET
(I O
had O
water). O

This O
was O
2 O
times O
what O
the O
same O
meal O
would O
have O
cost O
at O
Le O
Peep. O

Snooze O
provided O
an O
inventive O
pancake O
offering, O
but O
Le O
Peep O
would O
have O
provided O
better O
service O
and O
quality. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view B-TARGET
! O

– O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
pleased O
to O
report O
that O
my O
dinner O
at O
Ray's B-TARGET
Boathouse I-TARGET
last O
Friday O
completely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations. O

Ray's O
is O
something O
of O
a O
Seattle O
institution, O
but O
given O
its O
gorgeous O
Sound B-TARGET
views I-TARGET
, O
I O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O
food O
and O
service. O

Imagine O
my O
happy O
surprise O
upon O
finding O
that O
the O
views B-TARGET
are O
only O
the O
third-best O
thing O
about O
Ray's B-TARGET
! O

To O
start O
things O
off, O
our O
lovely O
server O
Brooke B-TARGET
was O
quickly O
on O
hand O
to O
take O
my O
drink O
order. O

My O
party O
of O
two O
was O
feeling O
particularly O
ambitious, O
and O
we O
splurged O
on O
the O
Shilshole B-TARGET
Sampler I-TARGET
...a O
beautiful O
assortment O
of O
enormous O
white B-TARGET
gulf I-TARGET
prawns I-TARGET
, O
smoked O
albacore O
tuna, O
Ray's O
fantastic O
manila B-TARGET
clams I-TARGET
seasoned O
with O
dill, O
scallops O
in O
a O
tasty O
soy B-TARGET
dressing I-TARGET
, O
and O
a O
tiny O
pile O
of O
Dungeness O
crab O
atop O
a O
sublime O
butter B-TARGET
sauce I-TARGET
. O

For O
my O
entr&eacute;e, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
seared B-TARGET
Alaskan I-TARGET
sea I-TARGET
scallops I-TARGET
complemented O
by O
chard, O
artichoke O
hearts, O
fennel, O
and O
pecorino O
toscano. O

The O
scallops B-TARGET
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
(not O
to O
mention O
tasty). O

My O
friend O
enjoyed O
the O
grilled B-TARGET
Alaskan I-TARGET
King I-TARGET
Salmon I-TARGET
with O
delectable O
creamed B-TARGET
Washington I-TARGET
russet I-TARGET
potatoes I-TARGET
and O
crisp O
green B-TARGET
beans I-TARGET
. O

I O
had O
a O
taste O
of O
all O
three O
items O
on O
her O
plate B-TARGET
, O
and O
they O
were O
superb. O

Our O
server B-TARGET
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray's B-TARGET
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner? O

Two O
rascally O
kids O
were O
seated O
near O
us O
for O
the O
first O
part O
of O
our O
dinner...they O
were O
replaced O
by O
a O
delightful O
preteen O
who O
pretended O
to O
gag O
every O
time O
seafood O
was O
mentioned O
at O
her O
table. O

Given O
that O
Ray's O
is O
a O
seafood O
restaurant...well, O
you O
get O
the O
idea... O

All O
considered, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray's B-TARGET
Boathouse I-TARGET
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution. O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us, O
our O
wonderful O
server B-TARGET
and O
food B-TARGET
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one. O

Oh O
yeah...the O
view B-TARGET
was O
good, O
too. O
